"BDef and BMech Modification : with Integrity Alerts (80/20 rule applied)  This has been on ongoing discussion about the extent to  which Fedora will support versioning of BDef and BMech  objects.   General things we agree to: 1. We will allow changes that do not break  existing ""behavior contracts."" So, we WILL support  adding methods to existing BDefs, but NOT modification  or deletion of methods. 2. We will not enforce that a BMech implements all  methods of a BDef. So, if a BDef has a new method  added to it, that method does not have to be  implemented by all associated BMechs. So, it could be  the case that new methods may not always be  available. The idea would be that all BMechs would  eventually implement newly defined BDef methods, but  Fedora will not consider a BMech broken when it does  not implement new methods. 3. Date-time stamped API-A requests. If API-A  requests to see methods supported by an object are  given date-time stamps, we well return the list of  methods implemented at the time specified. A note on Disseminator Versioning. Regarding  modifiation of Disseminators on Data Objects (which  point to BDef and BMech objects, the only valid changes  that can be made are those that do not break existing  behavior contracts on the Data Object. Thus it is  permitted to change descriptive labels, or change the  BMech that the Disseminator points to. Changing the  BMech can only be done if it does not require different  datastream bindings. These permitted changes will  cause the Disseminator to be versioned.  Changing a BDef on an existing Disseminator is NOT  allowed. A new BDef would require a new Disseminator  because ia different BDef means a different behavor  contract is being associated with the Data Object. We are still discussing what we should/should-not  support in the realm of BDef/BMech versioning beyond  the above. Date: 2005-11-16 11:24 Sender: payette Logged In: YES  user_id=128  The ""Force Purge"" feature can help here too:   Add option to be able to force purge of objects or datastreams even if the purge would violate referential integrity constraints. There are times this is desirable, and it's o.k. to have the repository in a temporary state of broken references. Clear example is removing a bmech object, when intent is to replace it with updated object. Check implications of loosening referential integrity checks on force purge and on modification of MIME on a datastream. (issues in Admininstrator? Elsewhere?) Date: 2005-11-16 11:23 Sender: payette Logged In: YES  user_id=128  More notes on the problem:   At this time, we do not allow modification of the datastreams of BDEF and BMECH objects, most notably the METHODMAP and WSDL datastreams. At the current time, modification of a BDEF/BMECH is achieved by purging the BDEF/BMECH, making changes to ingest file, and doing new ingest. Before BDEF/BMECH can be purged, all data objects that reference it must also be purged. Once new BDEF/BMECH in ingested, then all data objects are re-ingested. This is tedious.  However, there are two basic reasons we have not enabled direct modification of BDEF and BMECH objects:  1. Free editing of the xml content of these datastreams is dangerous in terms of potentially breaking data objects that are referring to the BDEF or BMECH. The most obvious case is modifying a datastream binding spec in a BMECH object in such a way that the datastream binding keys in the data objects are no longer valid. We need to decide what kinds of changes to BDEF and BMECH objects we will allow, to minimize potential breakage.  2. Given that we want to allow reasonable changes to BDEF and BMECH objects, the real issue to tackle is the current replication process that takes BDEF and BMECH xml data and populates the relational db. The replication of changes to the relational database is not set up properly to accomodate changes. Right now, there are relationships between the data objects and the bdef/bmech objects that depend on joins that use db-generated identifiers as join keys. Replication is generally a delete/insert process rather than an update process when it comes to BDEF and BMECH objects. This would result in rows with new db-generated identifiers and would break the joins to the data object tables which would reference old db-generated identifiers. We need to fix this.  We need to take a good look at the replicator code and figure out how to do database updates for changes to BDEF and BMECH datastreams. We also need to decide what client tools will enable the updating of BDEF and BMECH objects. Options: 1. Fedora Administrator Object Editor: When editing a BDEF or BMECH object, bring up special dialogs for editing METHODMAP and WSDL datastreams. Then send a modifyDatastream and have the server realize we are dealing with these special datastreams. Alternative is to send a whole new ingest file via a new API-M method (updateObject?) and have the server do some sort of diff analysis for BDEF and BMECH objects. 2. Modify the BDEF/BMECH builder to allow editing of these objects. Same issue on how changes are communicated to server. Do we have a new API-M method that allows a whole new ingest file to come in (updateObject) and then server does the diff thing?",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

The proposal is a looser binding of the disseminators by having content model objects that have disseminators on them.  Then, data objects can have a late binding of disseminators based on whether they (1) have the same content model (via content model identifier) or (2) have a relationship to a content model object in RELS-EXT.   Look at ways to extend the existing dissemination service to support this.  Another possibility is to implement this in the manner that the default disseminator is implemented in the ""dynamic behavior"" section of the code.

"Ingest/Export Whole Objects There are a number of features that are important for supporting ingest and export of objects. These are: 1.

This works well for migration (export from one repository and ingest into new repository) as long as the old repository is up and running at the time of the ingest into the new repository. Then the datastream content can be sucked into the new repository via callback URLs (getItem requests on default disseminator). However, if the old repository is not available after an export, or if you just want to dump and re-load the SAME repository we need a way to get the managed content out of the repository as part of the export. In the Fedora spec, we envisioned a variant of the export file with base-64 encoded binary content inlined for the managed content datastreams. Then, the export file is complete in that it has all the datastream content that was in the repository within it. We can either create another export method on API-M such as exportWithContent() or parameterize the existing export method. From the ingest standpoint, we need to implement logic to look for base64-encoded content or the content location URL as two alternatives.",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Proai multi-threaded record retrieval Broadly speaking, the cache update process for Proai has two phase: querying for updates and getting the content for each updated record. The latter phase could be made faster if it were multi-threaded. The following suggested solution depends on tracker item 669 (Proai robustness - transactions and error recovery) being done: - Instead of one, have n threads take x items off the queue and perform concurrent HTTP GETs of the content. Things to consider: - The solution doesn't necessitate that each thread perform it's own reads/writes from/to the db. - Use an appropriate level of abstraction here... possibly a string which is a ""locator"" (not necessarily a URL), so non-http OAIDriver impls can adjust.

"Selective Datastream Versioning Fedora has a placeholder in FOXML for the concept of selective datastream versioning. This is in the form of the ""versionable"" attribute on a datastream. Up until Fedora 2.1.1 datastreams are versioned automatically, and every datastream is subject to such versioning. This new feature will allow for versioning on whatever datastreams are marked as ""versionable."" A new API-M method will allow a client to set the versionable attribute on a datastream by datastream basis. The default is that datastreams are versioned. If a datastream was previously set as ""versionable"" and at a later time it is set to not be ""versionable"" the version history will not be purged, it will just stop the versioning from that point on.  This is very beneficial to avoid excessive or superfluous versioning for datastream that it is not necessary or desirable to version.

"Purge Datastream Versions by Date Range Currently, the purge datastream operation allows versions to be purged, but only from a specified date/time backwards in the version stack. There are times that it is desirable to purge just one version, or purge a set of versions within a data range. One important scenario is to be able to purge the most recent version of a datastream to support transactional activities (that may be set up in middleware above Fedora). If an such a middleware transaction is being managed, and middleware is required to roll back a transaction, it is typically necessary to be able to remove the most recent version of a datastream (given that that datastream was part of the transaction).  Many other cases can arise where it in important to be able to remove versions in a date range, for example, during testing processes, where a bunch of ""junk"" datastream versions get inserted in the version stack.  This feature is implemented by some changes to the Fedora API to accomodate the start/end date range in the purge operation.",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"New Triplestore Option: MPTStore A new triplestore to support core relationships management in the core Fedora repository will be developed for the following reasons: - make core repository not dependent on kowari - due to kowari instability issues and high memory requirements, we must ensure that the core repository is not vulnerable to these things - basic relationship management is something we can achieve with a simpler triplestore. - basic relationship management must be contained within the contect of a Fedora API-M transaction.  Right now, the kowari solution entails Fedora writing triples to a buffer that is outside the context of the Fedora API-M transaction, thus it cannot be guaranteed that such triples have successfully been written to the triplestore from the buffer by the time the Fedora API-M transaction is completed.  For these and other reason, a new triplestore is being developed using relational database technology. The design of this triplestore is based on mapped triple tables (thus MTP). It will hold all the same information currently in the Resource Index model.  Initially, it will support SPO queries. This will be an alternative configuration for the Resource Index in the core Fedora. It will still be possible to configure kowari as the triplestore.  At the same time, we are moving forward with designs to have a Resource Index service that can be outside the core Fedora repository. The idea is to have simpler and more tranasction-savvy relationship management at the core of Fedora, then be able to replicate the managed triples from the core to triplestore outside the repository (the Resource Index service) via messaging. The motivation here is to make the external service be where more semantic web activities happen (outside of the core repository). The base information from the repository can be enriched in the service (add information from other ontologies, add other kinds of relationships, whatever.) Then, full blown capabilities such as inferencing, can be done via the service without bogging down the core repository.",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"XACML IdReference support Blair has suggested that, by providing support for resolving XACML IdReferences, more flexible AuthZ can be achieved in Fedora.  This is an enhancement to existing functionality.  On Nov. 13, 2006, Blair wrote:  I'm fairly certain that the idea I'm working on for the ARROW project will provide a more flexible and efficient authz solution.  It will hopefully only require a simple addition to fedora.server.security.PolicyFinderModule to add support for finding policies based on idReference.  The idea is to make PolicySets that support the intuitive notion of letting more specific controls take precedence in authz evaluation.  For example; A Policy denying read access to a particular DO with PID 123 would take precedence over a Policy allowing access to a class of objects that the DO with PID 123 happens to be in (this class would be defined by metadata attributes such as the Dublin Core type).  The plan is to use the reserved POLICY datastream in every DO to hold the top level PolicySet passed to the PDP from the PolicyFinderModule.  This would be the PolicySet used for any authz evaluation pertaining to an action associated with a particular PID - almost all APIA and APIM operations.  Any authz controls required on actions that do not have a specific PID associated with them (such as ingest, describeRepository, findObjects) could have policies placed in the default repository wide policy directory, which would otherwise be empty.  The new top level PolicySet would comprise of a set of other PolicySets combined using the FirstApplicablePolicyAlg.  Therefore if a match were encountered early in the evaluation the result would be returned and evaluation finished; other irrelevant policies would not need to be evaluated.  The component PolicySets would be ordered from most to least specific with regard to their component Policy's Resource and Subject Targets, thus achieving the desired most specific overrides functionality.  See the attached layout for an example; note that this is illustrative of only one possible top level PolicySet structure, different combinations of referencing, in lining and further nesting could be used.",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"risearch fails to load stylesheets w/Jetty This is an issue when using Jetty, or any other webapp container that doesn't physically unpack the war file into the webapps directory on auto-deployment.

"HTTP Requests include bad HTTP basic Auth I've found a troublesome quirk about how Fedora calls URLs.  This applies when a disseminator is calling the URL and when Fedora retrieves Externally Referenced content.  When calling these URLs, Fedora passes an HTTP header like this one:  GET /2005/08/online_xslt/ HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: Fedora Authorization: Basic Og== Host: http://www.w3.org:5050/  The trouble is the Authorization line, which doesn't actually do anything.  The line should be omitted from the outgoing requests.  Some services (like the one in this example) take the authorization line to mean that you actually do want to authenticate.  When the authentication fails, the server returns information about the failed login rather than returning the publicly available content from the URL.  Try it yourself:  Go to this URL in your browser:   http://www.w3.org/2005/08/online_xslt/  You will see the publicly available page from that URL.  Now create an External Reference Datastream in Fedora that points to the same URL.  Point your browser at the new datastream.  It will hang for a second and then give you an empty page.  If you monitor the TCP traffic, you will see that the w3.org server is returning a ""401 Authorization Required"" message.

In local testing, I've seen exceptions thrown always on no password provided.  The difference could be due to the directory server used, I guess. I've changed the code defensively, but need to test before sending the patch.  I will also both (a) trap the lack of password in the Fedora code itself, so that it's an error to Fedora before JNDI is called; and (b) treat empty results returned from the results as non-authentication.

"Incorrect XACML demo policies involving state From Tom Wana to fedora-commons-developers, 8/13/07  Hi,  it seems as if the Fedora upstream XACML policies contain a bug. When testing for the state of an object or disseminator, there are no such states as ""Active"", ""Inactive"" etc. Instead you would have to use ""A"", ""I"" when writing the policy (this took me a few hours to track down...).  For example, Fedora ships with deny-purge-object-if-active-or-inactive.xml, which contains:       <Resources>        <Resource>          <ResourceMatch MatchId=""urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:function:string-equal"">            <AttributeValue DataType=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"">Active</AttributeValue>            <ResourceAttributeDesignator AttributeId=""urn:fedora:names:fedora:2.1:resource:object:state""              MustBePresent=""false""              DataType=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string""/>          </ResourceMatch>        </Resource>        <Resource>          <ResourceMatch MatchId=""urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:function:string-equal"">            <AttributeValue DataType=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"">Inactive</AttributeValue>            <ResourceAttributeDesignator AttributeId=""urn:fedora:names:fedora:2.1:resource:object:state""              MustBePresent=""false""              DataType=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string""/>          </ResourceMatch>        </Resource>      </Resources>  But because the state is never ""Active"" or ""Inactive"" (but ""A"" or ""I""), this rule never applies and is in effect useless. Which you can easily check yourself by purging an object which is active or inactive, which this rule should prevent, but it works.  When you replace ""Active"" with ""A"" and ""Inactive"" with ""I"", the rule applies, and you can no longer purge such objects.  So it seems as if all occurrences of ""Active"", ""Inactive"" and ""Deleted"" need to be rewritten to ""A"", ""I"" and ""D"" to do their job.  Perhaps you should also include some test cases to check if the default policies actually work.",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Option to pass backend service errors through Peter suggested that it would be useful if, when using API-A Lite, if a backend HTTP service gives a non-200 response, instead of having Fedora return a generic 500 error, it returned the exact error code and payload that the backend service returned.  In practical terms, this would simplify debugging by passing the ultimate error straight through.  Dan and I talked about this and believe it's appropriate to retain the ability to hide the cause of the error (in effect, to have Fedora intercept the error, log it, and provide a unique event id for later lookup by an authorized user).

"Resolve multiple fTypes With the CMDA changes, a new ""Fedora Object Type"" (fType) was introduced: ""C"".  Now the set of possible fTypes includes ""O"" (data object), ""D"" (bdef object), ""M"" (bmech object), and ""C"" (content model object).  The fType attribute has always been a single-valued required attribute.  With the CMDA changes, this was turned into a repeating attribute of the DigitalObject class.  We need to decide whether we really want this, long-term.  Things to consider:  1) How would it be specified in the FOXML or METS if multiple values were allowed (a delimited string, or multiple elements/attributes?)  2) It is currently not possible to ingest an object that specifies it's of multiple Fedora Object types.  Schematron validation (foxml and mets) both catch this as an error.  3) If it were possible, we don't have any tests that exercise this capability: none of the test/demo objects are of multiple types.  Things that would be particularly important to test include:   - How the resource index update behaves when an object is of two types.   - How the fieldsearch interface would behave.   - How the admin client indicates multiple types to the user.  On the other hand, if we decide to back off of this ""multi-valued fType"" capability, the DigitalObject class and DOReader, etc., should be updated to use a simple getter/setter for this value.",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Implement search-and-bind style LDAP authn This was requested by multiple users as a more flexible way to allow LDAP authentication.  For details, see:  http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=46083EEA.2040004%40georgetown.edu  Hello all,  This is my first post to the list, so by way of introduction: At Georgetown University, we are just beginning to do a Fedora pilot project, so we're newbies in that arena. But we do have extensive experience in various aspects of AAA middleware, including LDAP. I and another Georgetown staff member are also on the Shibboleth core development team (he is in fact the Shibboleth Java project lead). Over the next few months we might be interested in contributing to Fedora in those areas (via expertise and/or code) if there is a need and a desire for that.   I had previously sent some questions over on the users list regarding the new LDAP auth filter that shipped with v2.2. I understand from Richard Green that there was a patch to the 2.2 version, documented here:  http://www.fedora.info/wiki/index.php/Authenticating_Fedora_2.2_against_LDAP  The patch however has subsequently been found to have other bugs and so the LDAP code is currently being rewritten. That being the case, I wanted to offer a comment/suggestion on how the LDAP auth is configured and attempted. Apologies if this has already been discussed.  I haven't seen the patch, so I can only infer what the patch might be doing based on the LDAP auth wiki topic, but the main observation that I have is that: the original code does not support (and the patch does not appear to support) the standard ""search-and-bind"" style of doing LDAP auth. The style apparently supported in the patch by that new init-param 'bind-filter' (which I would point out isn't really a filter, BTW...) using a DN substitution pattern works for many people in many environments (it does in fact work for our current LDAP environment here at GU), but it makes 2 critical assumptions that don't hold for everyone:  1) Assumes that users exist in a single OU/container in the directory - Many people have LDAP designs which put users in multiple OU's/containers. You could mitigate that by having instead a list of DN substitution patterns to try, but that's a little inefficient.  2) Assumes that the ""username"" is part of the LDAP DN - This isn't always the case. Some people use a unique, opaque identifier to construct the DN, based on a GUID or a Person Registry ID or something else that's unique and persistent. Others use other attributes of the user to construct the last RDN component in the DN, for example Active Directory by default does something like 'CN=""Brent Putman"", CN=Users, DC=domain, DC=org' (or at least used to, I'm not an MS expert).   So the search-and-bind style of LDAP auth is the the only technique (that I know of at least) that works for all environments and LDAP designs. This is supported in and AFAIK is in fact the primary way that people do LDAP auth in well-known software projects such as Apache httpd, Apache Tomcat (via the JNDI Realm, although that supports both bind styles) and most others that I've had occasion to work with. If that gives you the warm fuzzies. :-)  In short, that style of auth is: 1) bind to the directory, either anonymously or with a privileged DN (depending on whether the users to be authenticated are publicly visible and searchable within the directory) 2) search for the user by constructing an LDAP search filter based on the supplied username, e.g. ""(uid=putmanb)"". 3) test user credentials by attempting to bind/rebind as the DN returned in step 2, using the password supplied by the user  So since the code is being rewritten anyway, I would ask that these comments be taken into account - it would make Fedora's LDAP capabilities available to a broader array of organizations. Time permitting (we're trying to get Shibboleth 2.0 out the door...), I might be able to help in getting this implemented and/or tested , etc.   Thanks, Brent",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

After creation of each object, we index it right away, calling the fedoragsearch, then we create the next item. The more items we created the slower the system became. We discussed that and thought, this might happen because of the optimization of the index every time we index a single object.   So what we did was that we changed the code in the OperationsImpl-class so the index only gets optimized each 1000ths object. Running the test again, we saw that the system became much faster.  Maybe the fedoragsearch should have a configuration so we could choose if the index has to get optimized after each indexing of a single item.

"Dissemination problems in objects with POLICY datastreams Under 2.2.x, there is a policy in the set of default repo-wide policies named  deny-policy-management-if-not-administrator.xml that restricts all access to the POLICY datastream unless you have fedoraRole=administrator. This attribute is only available if basciAuth is enabled. This is always the case for API-M so administrator can always access POLICY datastream through API-M. For API-A, the POLICY datastream cannot be accessed unless basicAuth is enabled for API-A and user has fedoraRole=administrator.  Under 3.0b1, we seem to have introduced some new dependency on the POLICY datastream with regard to disseminations so that if an object contains a POLICY datastream, this causes an AuthZException to be consistently thrown when attempting any getDisseminations. Removing the deny-policy-management-if-not-administrator.xml repo-wide policy or removing the POLICY datastream from the data object eliminates the problem, but this is a bug we need to run down before 3.0final release.  I believe this bug is related to how DefaultAccess.GetCMDADisseminationBindingInfo populates the dissBindingInfo data structure. Under 2.2.x, dissBindingInfo used a dbms join to select only those datastreams that were needed to fulfill the dissemination request. It appears that under 3.0b1, all datastreams in the object are being included in the dissBindingInfo data structure. Current logic in DisseminationService applies the policy constraint of ""enforce_Internal_DSState"" to each datastream found in dissBindingInfo. If an object happens to have a POLICY datastream, access to this datastream is denied unless the requesting user has fedoraRole=administrator. This will never happen when basicAuth is disabled for API-A. If basicAuth is enabled for API-A, access to the POLICY datastream is only allowed for fedoraRole=administrator, but this is still not the desired behavior. The result is that the initial dissemination request is denied because the requesting user does not have access to the POLICY datastream which is really irrelevant to the dissemination request. The fix seems to be either to filter the datastreams that are populated in dissBindingInfo to only include those datastreams that are needed in dissemination request or change logic in DisseminationService so policy constraint of ""enforce_Internal_DSState"" is only applied to those datastreams that are needed in dissemination request.  You can quickly test this in 3.0b1 by adding a POLICY datastream that permits-to-all(see attached) to one of the demo objects with disseminators. Attempts to run any disseminations on that object will result in AuthZExceptions. Remove the POLICY datastream and the disseminations will work. Note this is only an issue with getDissemination;  getDatastreamDissemination uses different logic and is unaffected.",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Problem with utf-8 characters in datastream Hello all  My name is John and at my company we are using Fedora 2.2.1  I have found a problem with utf-8 xml datastreams, only when the size is larger than 4K. Some times every 4K block, a utf-8 character is destroyed and shows as 2 other characters. I searched the source code and I found a wrong implementation for converting InputStream to StringBuffer. The class fedora.server.storage.translation.FOXMLDOSerializer has the method appendXMLStream. This method first reads 4096 bytes from the InputStream and then encodes them to utf-8. This is wrong, because some times the first byte of a utf-8 character is the last byte of the buffer and the second byte is the first byte of the next buffer. The right method to read the InputStream, is first to use a InputStreamReader (that encodes the InputSream to utf-8) and then to fill the buffer. I have modify that method like this:      private void appendXMLStream(InputStream in, StringBuffer buf, String encoding)             throws ObjectIntegrityException, UnsupportedEncodingException,             StreamIOException {         if (in==null) {             throw new ObjectIntegrityException(""Object's inline xml ""                     + ""stream cannot be null."");         }         try {             InputStreamReader inReader = new InputStreamReader(in, Charset.forName(encoding));             int bufSize = 4096;             char charBuf[] = new char[bufSize];             int len;             while ( ( len = inReader.read(charBuf, 0, bufSize) ) != -1 ) {                 buf.append(charBuf, 0, len);             }         } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException uee) {             throw uee;         } catch (IOException ioe) {             throw new StreamIOException(""Error reading from inline xml datastream."");         } finally {             try {                 in.close();             } catch (IOException closeProb) {                 throw new StreamIOException(""Error closing read stream."");             }         }     }  I hope this fix to be useful to non-latin users of fedora.

"Improved HTTP 1.1 support  (ETag/Last-Modified) Purpose: To support various caching http clients and utilities, such as Squid.  Ultimately, to improve performance.  Description:  ETags (opaque) and Last-Modified (a date) both effectively provide a ""state indicator"" to caches (such as those in sophisticated web clients and proxy servers).  When one or both of these pieces of information are provided in HTTP HEAD responses, a full GET request can be avoided if the signature hasn't changed.  Used properly, these indicators can dramatically improve overall web application performance.  Details: For inline and managed datastreams, the last modified date is known, so the state indicator can be provided for both getDatastreamDissemination and getDissemination (where the input is one of these kinds of datastreams and it doesn't pass through a service).  For providing the state indicator on other disseminations, a naive approach is to use the object's last modified date, but this needs to be considered carefully.  For example, in the case where a dissemination goes through a remote service, even if the inputs are known to have not changed since last time, Fedora can't know if the dissemination output has changed because the service's underlying processing may have.    One way forward in this case is to provide a way to mark the bound service operations as volatile (in which case the state indicator would never be given) and non-volatile with an associated date (in which case the combination of the dates of the datastream inputs and the service would be used to derive the state indicator).  However, in the case where any of the datastream inputs are volatile, the state indicator could not be given.  For E and R datastreams, the default assumption could be ""volatile"".  But it would be nice to have the ability to mark either as non-volatile, so the date could be used as a state indicator.",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"DOReader currently being used to *modify* DO The DOReader.java interface is ""for reading Fedora digital objects"" according to the javadoc comment.  However, it is being used to *modify* objects. See for example line 852 of DefaultManagement.java, which is:  w.getAuditRecords().add(audit);  I believe this is a violation of the DOReader contract.  A solution would be for SimpleDOReader.getAuditRecords() to return copies instead of the real objects (please note that it will have some impact on DefaultManagement.java at least).

Can we simply assume that no repository will have more than 1 million content models, ergo the cache will use less than 1 gigabyte?

"OutOfMemory Errors when modifying large objects We frequently encounter OutOfMemoryErrors when calling modifyDatastreamByValue and other API-M methods on relatively large digital objects using Fedora Commons 3.0b1, 3.0b2 and 3.0. In order to better understand the issue we triggered heap dumps and analyzed them. The dumps revealed that up to 140M of heap space get used by Fedora when calling modifyDatastreamByValue on a digital object of 15M.  In order to provoke heap dumps at each api call the heap size was reduced. Additionally we triggered heap dumps at specific locations programmatically using the Java6 HotSpotDiagnosticMXBean.  The OutOfMemoryError always occurs at DOTranslationUtility.writeToStream() after the serialization. This appears to be the peak of heap usage for modifyDatastreamByValue. The heap dump shows the following composition of objects at the time of writeToStream() (see attached screenshot):  * StringBuffer (60M) (15M * 2 (internal UTF-16 representation)) + 30M memory allocated by StringBuffer (StringBuffer doubles its capacity automatically when unsufficient capacity is left for appending a new String. Hence the capacity is likely to exceed the actual memory needed unless explicitly allocated).  * char[] array at writeToStream (StringBuffer.toString()) (31M) (15M * 2 + overhead)  * BasicDigitalObject 24M (15M DatastreamXMLMetadata, 9M AuditRecord)  * DOReaderCache 25M (1 BasicDigitalObject in cache at the time)  * Some other small objects   If the heap space is already consumed to a large extent, allocating another chunk of memory may fail and subsequently trigger an OutOfMemoryError. Explicitly calling the garbage collector is not a viable option, because most of the objects involved are still bound locally to the thread, so they are still reachable.   Increasing the heap will solve the issue temporarily. Depending on the size of the digital object the problem may however resurface: Suppose the digital object is 30M, then according to our findings a heap space of 60M*2 StringBuffer + 60M char array + ~50M DO + ~50M cache = 280M would be needed for a single digital object (we haven't tried this however).  We modified the Fedora code and tried the following options: * We removed the indentation in the FOXMLDOSerializer and DOTranslationUtility. Removing most of the nonessential whitespaces (or replacing indentation whitespaces with tabs) results in a much smaller DO size (about 20% in our test case) and therefore reduces memory footprint.   * As for the StringBuffer problem we basically tried two approaches. We trimmed the StringBuffer in FOXMLDOSerializer before the call to writeToStream() using the trimToSize() method. This adjusts the capacity of the StringBuffer to the actual size of characters contained within. Another option is to explicitly size the buffer.   * The 64 bit version of Java consumes considerably more heap space compared to the 32 bit version. Using a 32 bit version reduces memory usage.   All options mentioned above work well and reduce memory consumption significantly, but solve the underlying problem only partially.  Perhaps a better solution would be to load and process only those parts of the digital object needed for the current operation (not viable for ingest, but e.g. modifyDatastreamByX), but that would probably involve lots of refactoring...",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Attempt to run disseminations even if a ""required"" datastream is unavailable Ross@UVA reported that when attempting to run a dissemination where a DSInputSpec-defined datastream is unvailable, but not really required by the particular dissemination being run, it's caught as an error and the dissemination fails to run.  A set of objects that provoke this is attached as hydra-objects.zip  Here is Ross' email describing his investigation of the cause of the current behavior in Fedora 3.1:  ---  I think I pinpointed this problem in code for DefaultAccess near line 500:         DisseminationBindingInfo[] bindingInfo;        bindingInfo = new DisseminationBindingInfo[dsBindRules.length];         for (int i = 0; i < dsBindRules.length; i++) {            DeploymentDSBindRule dsBindRule = dsBindRules[i];            String dsPid = dsBindRule.pid == null ?                    dObj.GetObjectPID() : dsBindRule.pid;            String dsId = dsBindRule.bindingKeyName;            Datastream ds;             DOReader reader = m_manager.getReader(false, context, dsPid);            ds = reader.GetDatastream(dsId, versDateTime);             if (ds == null) {                String message =                        ""The object \""""                                + dsPid                                + ""\"" ""                                + ""contains no datastream with ID \""""                                + dsId                                + ""\"" ""                                + ""that was created on or before the specified date/timestamp ""                                + "" of \""""                                + DateUtility.convertDateToString(versDateTime)                                + ""\"" ."";                throw new DatastreamNotFoundException(message);            }  This logic will throw exception if *any* of the datastream binding rules are not satisfied. I think part of the problem is that the dsInputSpec definition of binding rules is too broad; it just defines a set of binding rules for a particular sDep and does not differentiate which binding rules are associated with which method.  To fix this, I think you would need to either gather additional information from wsdl or methodMap about which bindings were required for each method or add additional information to dsInputSpec that allows you to specify which method a binding rule is associated with...  I suppose if we wanted to be really loose re referential integrity, you could just omit this check and have the dissemination method fail in DisseminationService at run time. That way, methods with matching binding rules would still work and only ones with missing binding rules would fail...  This logic is probably a leftover from Fedora 2.2 when we wanted to catch any case where binding rules were not satisfied since all binding rules had to be satisfied when referential integrity was tight.",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"SDef/SDep design improvements supporting LANL jpeg2000 service Supporting the LANL JPEG2000 Service at  http://african.lanl.gov/aDORe/projects/djatoka/  is a good example, but the goal of this improvement is to support that and other services by improving how SDefs/SDeps can work.    The problem is that a lot of existing http-exposed services have ""APIs"" of their own.  ANd it's hard to put those behind disseminations on digital objects.  Another example: Imagine a dissemination endpoint for an object that represented a collection, and you want to expose that object as an OAI-PMH repository endpoint.  For Fedora to be able to accomodate such a thing, we need to think more broadly about how dissemination calls can be made on objects.  This includes addressing both the ""path syntax"" and the set of possible http verbs that Fedora can expose as dissemination endpoints.  One approach that has been mentioned is to make Fedora act more like an http proxy.

"Document and consolidate what needs to be writable at runtime I had a hard time installing Fedora Repository 3.1 on Unix thanks to the need for a writable FEDORA_HOME. Typically Unix software is installed by an admin, and users given limited privileges to the few files and directories they absolutely need to write to.  Obviously there needs to be an area where datastreams are kept, but requiring all of FEDORA_HOME (children directories included) to be writable seems somewhat excessive. FEDORA_HOME contains mostly code and configuration files, which don't need to (and in fact, shouldn't) be written to by Fedora.   Through trial and error, I got away with allowing only the following directories to be writable:  FEDORA_HOME/data FEDORA_HOME/server/status FEDORA_HOME/server/logs FEDORA_HOME/server/management FEDORA_HOME/server/fedora-internal-use FEDORA_HOME/server/fedora-internal-use/fedora-internal-use-backend-service-policies  I think it would be quite helpful to document which specific directories need to be writable, and maybe consolidate them into one place.

"Broken relative includes in stylesheets -- only absolute paths work GSearch results are transformed using stylesheets. Said stylesheets include other stylesheets using <xsl:include/> elements. Unfortunately, only full absolute paths appear to work for the purpose of inclusion; relative includes don't.

This is simply a configuration change to the proai.properties file (detailed in the attachment), but in order to work reliably, requires special processing by the Fedora OAIProvider in order to deal with DC values that contain whitespace characters.  The patch replaces such characters, when they occur, with underscores so they are syntactically valid with respect to the OAI-PMH protocol, which does not allow spaces in setSpec names.  2) The use of the Fedora object's PID as the oai itemID.  This is convenient because it avoids the problem of the appearance of duplicate records when a) using the default configuration (which uses dc:identifier) and b) multiple dc:identifiers exist in record object's DC datastreams.

So, just to make sure, the basic strategy you're thinking of is:   First, refactor so that all datastream access (for content stored outside fedora's control) goes consistently through ExternalContentManager.  This includes all runtime access to ""R"" and ""E"" datastreams, as well as ""M"" datastreams when they are ingested by reference.   Next, add file:// (and potentially other) resolutions to an impl of ExternalContentManager (why not DefaultExternalContentManager?), with adequate administrative control over which dirs on the local machine can be loaded from when the URL happens to be a file:/// one.

"References to in-fedora resources don't work properly in alternate app server contexts General, portable, ""relative"" links to in-fedora content were previously handled by variable substitution.  e.g. in a redirect datastream or WSDL text body ""http://local.fedora.server/fedora/risearch"" would be translated at runtime or at serialization time (depending on context) to ""http://localhost:8080/fedora/risearch"", and vice versa.  Now, with repository app server context (e.g. the '/fedora' part) a configurable option, the existing substitution mechanism breaks down.  Since it does NOT substitute local app server context, the app server context will remain an assumption hard-coded in the object and links will fail if the object is ingested into a repository with a different app server context.  That is to say, if an object contains ""http://local.fedora.server/fedora/risearch"", and is ingested into a repository that has app server context ""fedora32"", the resulting URL as dereferenced at runtime will be   ""http://localhost:8080/fedora/risearch"", which is WRONG.  It should be ""http://localhost:8080/fedora32/risearch.    This can be addressed by a) introducing a variable substitution for context only, as in ""http://local.fedora.server/local.fedora.context/risearch"" or b) abandoning explicit variable substitution, and adopt relative or absolute path conventions.  In the case of (b) suggested conventions as discussed at a recent committers meeting (http://fedora-commons.org/confluence/x/w4mv) are    - absolute paths are interpreted as belonging to the same server and port as the fedora instance (equivalent to current local.fedora.server substitution).  i.e. (""/saxon/transform?x=y"" might translate to ""http://localhost:8080/saxon/transform?x=y)   - relative paths are interpreted as belonging to the fedora app server context.  i.e. (""risearch?x=y"" might translate to ""http://localhost:8080/fedora32/risearch?x=y)  CAVEAT The general consensus was to go with (b), path conventions.  However, either (a) or (b)  presents a compatibility problem with previous versions of Fedora, in that objects exported and complying with (a) or (b) conventions will be broken if exported and ingested into any earlier Fedora version.  The reason for this is that earlier fedora versions would not support either expansion scheme, and would not be able to interpret the URLs appropriately.  At present, there doesn't seem to be a good way to support differing app server contexts and link expansion without breaking compatibility.

"Permgen grows when Fedora deployed/undeployed w/o restarting Tomcat Reported by Graham Triggs:  When repeatedly deploying/undeploying the Fedora webapp (without restarting Tomcat), the JVM permgen size continues to grow.  This can lead to an eventual out-of-memory condition.  This is caused by a failure of classes to be unloaded.  Graham has seen this before, and has dealt with it by using a ""cleanup context listener"" that gets invoked at shutdown time.  Part of this is due to JDBC drivers not being automatically unregistered when the webapp is stopped (this is what the attached java file deals with).  Part also appears to be caused by a JAXP DocumentBuilderImpl reference that is being held by a ThreadLocal.  This reference hasn't been tracked down fully yet.  While investigating this issue, Graham came across a flaw in the shutdown code that can prevent clean shutdown if ManagementModule doesn't shut down properly:  ""...during the shutdown code, the ManagementModule hadn't been fully initialised, so it was then throwing an exception during shutdown (not an MSE), so all the remaining modules never had their shutdown code called (and so the Thread wasn't stopped, and Tomcat couldn't stop).  The local fix is to add a null check to ManagementModule's shutdown procedure:      public void shutdownModule() throws ModuleShutdownException {         if (invocationHandlers != null) {             for (AbstractInvocationHandler h : invocationHandlers) {                 h.close();             }         }     }  Thus preventing an NPE that can occur.

"Allow Fedora to be deployed as a generic WAR From Asger Blekinge-Rasmussen:  (In a discussion at OR'09) we came up with a total redesign of the fedora install procedure. Here goes, from memory:  1. Fedora is just a .war file. There is no installer. (Distribution includes the Fedora WAR and Fedora.fcfg file.) 2. You install said war file in a tomcat. (Renaming the WAR file as necessary to indicate the preferred context name) 3. Upon init of the war file, fedora reads /fedora/fedora.fcfg, or another location specified in the war file's web.xml (or specified by command line or environment variable) 4. This config file specifies, among all the things it already does, the Fedora Home dir. 5. If this dir does not exist, it is created and populated with the nessesary stuff from the war file.  The purpose of the current installer is primarily to set up the web.xml. That settings have to be set up in the web.xml is unfortunate, but unavoidable. (The installer also creates and moves files to fedora home, but this can be done during WAR startup.)  The features that are set up, again from memory: 1. SSL endpoints 2. Other endpoints 3. Servlet filters for Authentication  As far as we could establish, the SSL endpoints are somewhat odd, since people would probably use the tomcat in SSL, rather that the specific web application.  The other endpoints, we envisage, are default enabled. The fedora.fcfg specify which class should handle requests for each endpoint, and thus certain endpoints could have stub  implementations per default.  Preferences which were used to set up the servlet filters in the installer could be added to fedora.fcfg then read by a single filter which is always available.",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"With AuthZ off, REST API allows execution of unauthenticated requests I'm playing with our Fedora 3.2 instance and the REST API.  I'm using the Firefox Poster add-on to do an http POST of some simple valid FOXML to the (example) http://fedorabox:8080/fedora/objects/newpid:foobar  URI and am running into problems.  The first time I attempt to do the POST, I get the error ""The PID 'newpid:foobar' already exists in the registry; the object can't be re- created."" even though it is a brand new object.  However, if I search Fedora for the object, I do find it was created.  When I look through the logs, I see that Fedora tries to create the object twice with this one request.  If I try to POST a second object with a new pid and new FOXML, the requests succeeds without error.  Fedora only tries the ingest once.  My guess is that the initial authentication handshake with the first POST causes Fedora to attempt the ingest twice.  The second POST succeeds since the browser is already authenticated, and doesn't need to go through the handshake.  I ran into this because I have some client software that authenticates with every post (since it's not a browser) and I keep running into this problem.  I did not have this issue with 3.0 or 3.1.  I have included the stacktrace error below.  Has anyone else run into this?  Any help appreciated.

Extra Quotes Added to Literal RELS-EXT Values When using the Fedora Administrator GUI application to add untyped literal objects to RELS-EXT relationships the literal value you supply is surrounded by quotes. On subsequent edits (or additions of other relationships) using the GUI the initial quotes are surrounded by yet another pair of quotes. The original quotes are then escaped and persisted. This happens as many times as you use the GUI to modify the relationships.      See attached screenshot for example.,legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Allow the API-M.getDatastream method of the REST API to be handled as if it were an API-A method for authentication purposes The API-M.getDatastream method, also known as getDatastreamProfile, provides information about a datastream similar to the way getObjectProfile provides information about an object. When API-A auth is off, the getObjectProfile method does not require authentication, but the getDatastreamProfile does, since it is part of API-M. This has caused quite a bit of confusion for users of the web administrator as they are allowed to search for and look at objects without an authentication prompt, but attempting to look at the datastream profile requires authentication (even though downloading the datastream content does not.) This odd behavior can be relieved by allowing getDatastreamProfile to be handled as an API-A method in the REST API for the purposes of authentication.  Of course, this brings up the question of whether this method really belongs in API-M and if it should be moved to API-A for the SOAP API as well.

"Way of testing requests for Authorization w/o running them Carsten Friedrich wrote to fedora-commons-developers on Jul 23 '09:  In many cases it would be good to know if an operation is allowed before it is attempted. Especially when designing a client application that talks to Fedora it can be quite frustrating for a user to fill in a large form only to learn when pressing ""submit"" that he is actually not allowed to perform this operation. Ideally the client tests this before displaying the form and disables it (or the submit button) to save the user the pointless effort. Can we add a policy API which allows users to do so?  It seems that this could be done with minimal effort since all the functionality is already there. All that's needed is to expose the authorization checks as separate web-service calls.",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Recommended use of entity references for special characters in web admin As reported by Richard Green on the dev mailing list, the web admin fails with an error when attempting to include encoded characters, using name encoding, within XML datastream content. Using number encoding for these characters works fine. See a list of name and number encodings here: http://www.ascii.cl/htmlcodes.htm.  As an example, adding the line <dc:rights>&#169; Fedora Commons</dc:rights> to a DC datastream works fine, but attempting to add <dc:rights>&copy; Fedora Commons</dc:rights> fails with the error ""The entity 'copy' was referenced but not declared"". A few name encoded characters do work (such as &lt; and &gt;) but most do not.  The same errors are thrown when attempting this through the swing admin.  A note from Peter Cliff on this issue:   You need to define entities with names (&copy;) etc.  See:  http://www.xml.com/pub/a/98/08/xmlqna2.html http://www.tizag.com/xmlTutorial/xmlentity.php  So my guess is that somewhere some XML parsing/creating is happening behind the scenes of that client and it is throwing the whole thing off when the XML processing fails on account of an undefined entity?

If a resource has been created on the origin server, the response    SHOULD be 201 (Created) and contain an entity which describes the    status of the request and refers to the new resource, and a Location    header (see section 14.30).  Whilst an initial create is conformant to the spec as the posted resource becomes GETable at an alternate location (/content), not returning a Location header is highly confusing for new users/developers.

"CMA and server should support optional datastreams sensibly At present, Fedora's CMA does not formally allow optional datastreams.  It is very important to the Hydra Project (and I think to Asger's group in Denmark too?) that it should.  At present, because content models are not enforced, you can effectively have optional dss providing that you do not call an optional one that has not been implemented.  If you do call a missing ds I believe you get a 500 error.  We in Hydra would prefer that Fedora return an empty response ( eg <xml></xml>).  To match this, the content model definition would need to support something like:   <dsTypeModel ID=""techMetadata"" type=""optional"">              <form MIME=""text/xml""/>  </dsTypeModel>             This would make for very much simpler, more flexible, content modelling.  Example use case 1:  Hydra will define a common metadata object for all content.  This will contain all the dss that we think a good repository would want (locally an installation can, of course, supplement them).  One of these dss would be 'contentMetadata' which is applicable only to objects that of themselves can generate a splash page.  Better to have one metadata model with 'contentMetadata' optional than have to maintain two?  Example use case 2:  Hydra will define a 'simple image' content model which will be used to deliver the same image at a variety of resolutions.  There may or may not be a protected 'original' or 'archive' copy (possibly in a different format) in the same object.

It's problematic when the datastream id ends with .xml.  We discussed this on the Sept15th call and decided to get rid of the .xml shortcut as a solution.

"Certain ingests may report failure, but retain the object in the registry, filesystem, and RI in an unreadable state. The error occurred again, and this time we are able to reproduce it.  As  far as I can tell, it looks like when Fedora checks and verifies that a  foxml file is well-formed, it then creates a stub object, then checks  the datastreams.  If validation of the datastreams fails under certain  conditions, Fedora returns an error, but leaves the stub object in the  file system and in the database.  To reproduce this: The steps to reproduce the error are (using attached files)  1. Compare the content of DemoFail.xml and DemoSuccess.xml. They should  differ only in the location of the attribute xmlns:xlink: on the element <foxml:digitalObject> (DemoFail) or <mods:mods> (DemoSucess).  2. Ingest object demo:failObject from DemoSuccess.xml; it should be  successful.  3. Purge the object demo:failObject.  3. Ingest object demo:failObject from DemoFail.xml; it will fail because  of the location of the xlink namespace declaration.  4. Since the object was not ingested, try to repeat step 2.

"RELS-EXT is not validated on creation, only validated when updated See recent report on dev list from Richard Jones for Fedora 3.2  Reproduced on 3.2.1 and on the trunk (post RELS-INT integration).  Richard reports that adding a new RELS-EXT datastream using the REST API with a dateTime literal that is invalid, eg 2009-10-05T16:02:26+0100, is not validated.  However updating the datastream (eg adding a new relationship) then results in a validation error.  Reproduced using the admin client (so this is not limited to the REST API): create a new object, add RELS-EXT with invalid date time, does not result in a validation error.  However subsequently amending RELS-EXT does throw a validation error.  The bug is not limited to dateTime, this also occurs for integer values (eg 1.23 is allowed), and also occurs when adding relationships with predicates that are not allowed in RELS-EXT, so it would appear that RELS-EXT is not validated at all when it is created for the first time.",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Akubra replaces LLStore as primary blob storage abstraction In Fedora 3.2, Akubra was integrated as an implementation of the LLStore interface.

"Configurable parameters for the Fedora internal http client I ran into a curious performance issue when several students were testing a digital collection interface we have developed.  When all the students accessed the same search results page at the same time (a ""canned"" search page), the application would freeze up for several minutes.  The search results page contained 10 thumbnails, all of which were served up by Fedora via a disseminator.  After several hours of targeted load testing and debugging, I narrowed down the source of the problem to communication between Fedora and the backend web service that delivers the thumbnails.  I started digging through the source code, and found fedora.common.http.WebClient:  public class WebClient {      /** Seconds to wait before a connection is established. */     public int TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 20;      /** Seconds to wait while waiting for data over the socket (SO_TIMEOUT). */     public int SOCKET_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 120;      /** Maxiumum http connections per host */     public int MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOST = 5;      /** Maxiumum total http connections */     public int MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS = 20;      /** Whether to automatically follow HTTP redirects. */     public boolean FOLLOW_REDIRECTS = true;      /**      * Maximum number of redirects to follow per request if FOLLOW_REDIRECTS is      * true.      */     public int MAX_REDIRECTS = 3;   ... }  Suspecting that Fedora had run out of connections for making requests to my backend web service, I manually changed WebClient.java to bump up MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOST to 256, and MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS to 256, recompiled, then put the changed class file in place, restarted Tomcat, and re-executed my load tests.  The problem disappeared.  I'd like to request the following features be added to a future release of Fedora:  1.  Make the internal web client parameters configurable in fedora.fcfg (TIMEOUT_SECONDS, SOCKET_TIMEOUT_SECONDS, MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOST, FOLLOW_REDIRECTS, MAX_REDIRECTS)  2.

"Custom db - SQL Interface on Fedora objects For speed reasons we wanted a database that contains a part of the information Fedora contains in its foxml objects. We had considered gSearch and tried Mulgara, but came into problems. I longed for a database, as they are best for the kind of use-case we were saddled with. I came up with an idea and looked at Fedora's ability to do this for the dublin core datastream. I figured that it would be easy to extend that feature a bit, so that Fedora might do it for any kind of metadata. This was indeed not too difficult and with a few extra classes and a only a few changes of the original code this was realised.   The idea is that DefaultDOManager.dbspec is extended with this line:      <include href=""server/config/custom-db.xml"" />  Then in that file under the Fedora home config dir you can put your own database schema, which is an extension of the database schema used in the dbspec file. Of course you may then also add more include statements to the custom-db.xml file, so that you may configure parts of the database in separate files.  In the dbspec files the main setup is of tables which have columns. I have added values to those columns through defining value getters. Currently I have implemented only once such value getter that uses an xPath expression. The expression retrieves from the foxml or from a datastream of the foxml one or more values. This values getting code does not necessarily run for all digital objects. It is possible to choose one or more content models and/or datastream ids that must be present for the tables to be updated by the digital object, thus allowing for a tables to be updated only by a specific kind of digital object. Here is an example of table with two columns (not necessarily a practical example):  <table name=""easyFiles"" contentModel=""info:fedora/fedora-system:easyfile"" datastreamId=""file"">     <column name=""pid"" type=""varchar(64)"" notNull=""true"" index=""easyfile_pid"" binary=""true"">  <comment>The PID of the file object. Primary key of this table.</comment>     </column>      <column name=""filename"" type=""varchar(256)"" notNull=""true"" index=""filename"" default=""-"">         <value>              <valuegetter type=""xPath"" xPath=""//easyfile:filename"" nsPrefix=""easyfile"" nsUri=""http://easy.dans.knaw.nl/files"" delimiterType=""row"" />           </value> </column>  A table with the name ""easy_files""  is made that is filled for the digital obejcts that have the content model ""info:fedora/fedora-system:easyfile"" and have a datastream ""file"". The xPath expression ""//easyfile:filename"" runs over the file datastream and puts its values in the ""filename"" column. If multiple values are found it delimits those values by creating multiple rows (silly example I know).  The pid column must be present and is the only hardcoded column. It is maintained by the custom-db code.  As said before an xPath expression may return several values. For that two kinds of delimiters may be used. A row delimiter (meaning several rows are created for each value) and a normal delimiter (meaning a string value, by default a comma, is inserted after every value). Also a values tag may contain several valuegetter tags, which can be delimited in the same two ways. If two columns return two rows each those two column values are added together as one row. A possibility would be to add valuegetters for the second row that return a default value for that row if nothing was found, thus creating the possibility of composing rows almost any which way one wants.Of course one might also choose to use different types of valuegetters next to each other, but currently there is only the xPath implementation. The xPath implementation will typically cover most cases where somebody just wants to retrieve some basic information about their digital objects from a database. However, other types of implementations would be necessary if one would want to work with hierarchical data.   A pid must always be present, but does not need to be the primary key (primaryKey attribute of the table). It is up to the user how the data is composed into tables. Foreign keys may also be defined, though I found that I needed to fix a small bug in the code for this too work for PostgreSQL, since this code probably had been lying dormant in Fedora for years. I have tested this only with PostgreSQL, so I do not know if the Fedora code base has any more such bugs. My code did not need any addition to the Fedora database code except for this bugfix. One other advantage of having primary keys, foreign keys and also the notNull attribute is that if the values gotten from the foxml do not correspond to your database schema the database will thrown an exception which then makes it impossible to ingest the object. This is a free kind of data validation, though, admittedly, a bit weak. However using Fedora to do your database housekeeping is much more reliable than doing it yourself. If it gets in Fedora it gets into your database and if it didn't get in Fedora it didn't get into the database.  It's almost impossible for Fedora and the database to get out of sync. And if they do for some magical reason (get out of sync) one can still rebuild the database with the Fedora rebuild tool.  So with this simple system it is possible to do almost any kind of database synchronization based on Fedora data. I have seen many projects based on Fedora that employ a database alongside Fedora in order to speed up the querying process. I therefore think this might be useful for many such projects.  An extension to this would be possible through the search interface that comes with Fedora. It could be made to search through tables that the user defines. This wouldn't be a replacement of gSearch, but a simple alternative for those who need to achieve results quick. This was not needed for our project, since we use gSearch, so I have not taken the liberty to do so.   The attached source is based on the released source of Fedora 3.2.1. The code has been documented, optimized (for not doing the same stuph more than once) and tested (though unit tests are missing). The gist of it can be found under fedora.server.customdb.   Last but not least it should be mentioned that we use this feature already and have seen no problems with it so far. It also does not interfere in anyway with the normal functioning of Fedora. If one does not put anything in custom-db.xml then Fedora does not touch the custom-db code at all, so deciding to adopt this feature into the Fedora codebase does not endanger the overall project at all.

"Storage: Use UTC creation-date for foxml/datastream paths On Dec 7, 2009, Egbert Gramsbergen wrote to fedora-commons-users:  I noticed something strange in the data storage of Fedora.  Objects and datastreams are stored in a directory tree mirroring time down to the level of minutes, the time being creation time for objects and modifiction time for versionable datastreams. This should enable the repository to be reconstructed from the files in case of an emergency. So far so good.  But in my case, the times as implied form the directory tree are exactly one hour ahead of the times in the metadata in foxml. So it seems that ""directory tree"" time is local time (CET in my case) and ""metadata"" time is UTC. So if I really have to reconstruct the repository from the files, Fedora has to know about the timezone in which the repository was made. It seems brittle to me, and unnecessary. Why not use the same time for both? Or do I miss something?  btw, I use Fedora 3.0.",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"DefaultDOManager - object not invalidated from doreader cache upon purge Using the DefaultDOManager, digital objects are not removed from the DOReaderCache when purged.  They are, however, removed from the DOReaderCache when added or modified.  This results in cached copies of disseminations persisting and being served by Fedora, even after the purge has been committed.  This is problematic for our repository.  We have set up external indexing to initiate immediately after changes to Fedora.  Our indexer uses Fedora services to retrieve information about digital objects for indexing.  Because of this error, our indexer is indexing purged objects immediately after they are purged, yet the indexer does not know that the object has been purged because Fedora is still serving stale services.  Could this be fixed in the doCommit method of the DefaultDOManager class?  From what I can tell, it looks as if something like the following clause could be added to the OBJECT REMOVAL section of code to resolve the problem:  // INVALIDATE DOREADER CACHE if (m_readerCache != null) {   m_readerCache.remove(obj.getPid()) }",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Move to Java 6+ (Java 5 no longer supported) Fedora already works with Java 6, but we are considering discontinuing support for Java 5 for several reasons:  1) As of Nov 3, 2009, J2SE 5 has reached its End Of Service Life (EOSL).  This means there will be no more public updates to Sun's J2SE 5. 2) Finding and installing Java 5 on the various operating systems is becoming increasingly difficult. 3) Java 6 has several API and annotation improvements we'd like to be able to take advantage of in the source code.  (For example, IOException now has a constructor that accepts a Throable cause, and @Override can now apply to interface method implementations)  For now, this would also reduce the number of different configurations we'd need to test prior to release, thus shortening the release cycle.  In early January 2010, the committers agreed that this is the direction we want to go, but we should first poll our users to see what, if any, problems this might create for them.  Upon deciding to move to Java 6, the following changes should be made immediately:  A) Change the pom to compile to java 6 bytecode (and thus require a Java 6 JDK) B) Remove the JDBC3/4 code-rewriting hack in the build C) Modify the CI tests to run using Java 6",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Switch to SLF4J with Logback as primary logging framework SLF4J is a modern logging framework that, among other things, allows applications to cope with dependent libraries that hardcode dependencies on specific frameworks.  Fedora currently uses Log4J, and has to jump through hoops in order to get the logging frameworks (commons-logging, java.util.logging) of its dependent libraries to log to the same place.  Ideally, all fcrepo code should use the SLF4J api when logging is needed, and be agnostic about the underlying logging implementation.  Appropriate runtime dependencies can then be included in the classpath to get the desired implementation to be used for all logging operations, whether coming from the org.fcrepo classes, or from classes they depend on.  This can be done in a sane way with the help of SLF4J's legacy bridges[1].  Since the Fedora server has runtime dependencies on libraries that hardcode use of java.util.logging (sun-xacml), commons-logging (commons-httpclient and more), and log4j (mulgara), a bridge should be used for each of these frameworks so that all calls to them effectively go through SLF4J.  Lastly, there is the matter of the actual logging implementation to use (i.e., the ""sink"" for SLF4J).  It appears that Logback[2] is the way to go here: a) It's being actively developed as a replacement for log4j, by its founder. b) Generally, when a legacy bridge is used for SLF4J, the actual implementation cannot be used as the ""sink"", for reasons described at [1].

Tomcat should report ""SEVERE: Error filterStart"", Jetty reports ""failed AuthFilterJAAS javax.servlet.ServletException: FEDORA_HOME environment variable not set"".  Quick workaround if FeSL is not being used is to simply comment out the AuthFilterJAAS filter from Fedora's web.xml.  Prior to FeSL, none of the servlet filters required the value of FEDORA_HOME. Moreover, if the value of FEDORA_HOME is set via system property or environment variable, the problem does not manifest itself. Currently, ServletController retrieves the fedora.home context-param and sets the ""servlet.fedora.home"" System Property to make the value available to Constants.FedoraHome. However, if we can't guarantee that ServletController is loaded first, then the fedora.home context-param will not be available to the filters.

"Extend REST API to provide simple support for remote or tiered storage status information. Extend the REST API to provide simple protocol support for remote or tiered storage status information.  Likely this would return a 503 status code and a retry-after header if an authorized access operation was unable to retrieve a datastream from managed storage that was recognized as valid within the timeout period.  The work is primarily to provide support through the Fedora Repository core for the function.  In related work outside the scope of this issue, it will be required that the low-level storage plug-in be able to provide a suitable signal.  Additional efficiencies could be gained by supporting this in a HEAD request at least for datastream disseminations and considered for dissemination-type services.  This improvement is to enable minimal support for tiered storage plug-in which may have the datastream ""file"" off-line and may not be able to stream it before the timeout.

"Improved Authentication Challenge Control From https://fedora-commons.org/confluence/display/~cwilper/2010/03/18/Authentication+Challenge+Control+-+A+Thought+Experiment  Fedora's SOAP API has historically been split into two: API-A and API-M. The REST API, being resource-oriented, naturally isn't. And the control over which endpoints can be set to require authentication is inconsistent across the two. The old ""Authenticate for API-A? Authenticate for API-M?"" options no longer make sense when you look at Fedora's APIs as a whole.  Here's one way the situation could be improved.     1. For the SOAP API (all read-oriented and write-oriented methods), always require authentication.    2. For the REST API, on a per-verb basis (POST/PUT/DELETE/GET), offer the following options at install time:          1. Proactive Challenge: Always require authentication.          2.

"Enable optimistic locking for modify operations Extend Fedora API to support simple, optimistic locking for operations such as modify datastream. We've discussed implementing proper transaction support in Fedora for years (e.g. supporting JTA throughout), but supporting the very common use case of multiple users concurrently editing an object/datastream could be largely accomplished by supporting some form of optimistic locking.  As it stands, Fedora applications have to take elaborate steps to ensure one user doesn't step all over another user's work, and ultimately, can't guarantee this won't be the case.  For example, extend the relevant API methods to take a nillable lastModifiedDate.

Currently, the only way of dealing with this is to track down the problematic object(s) in the repository, remove or correct them in the underlying storage, and do a resource index rebuild.  Ideally, Fedora would have an option to either reject or auto-truncate such too-long values and avoid this inconsistency problem altogether.

"It is possible to specify apparently valid XACML policies that will never be effective FeSL (partially) implements the XACML 2.0 hierarchical resource profile [1]  This enables resources to be specified as a ""uri"" [2] in policies [3], including specifying resources using regular expression matches [4].  Only a subset of potential regex hierarchical URI specifications are used in the GenericPolicyFinderModule (actually -> PolicyManager -> DbXmlPolicyIndex) [5] which means that it is possible to create a policy using a resource URI with a regex which will never be located by the policy finder - thus the policy will never actually be used.  Example:  To specify all members of a collection, it is necessary to specify the full URI path, including all parents, so for an example collection demo:collection which is itself a member of demo:topCollection, it is necessary to specify: /demo:topCollection/demo:collection/.*  to specify all members of demo:collection.  If demo:collection were to be moved into demo:otherTopCollection the policy would no longer work.  It should be possible to specify members of a collection using only the immediate parent, ie something like .*/demo:collection/.*  (or something similar, regex probably needs tightening up a bit)  However such a regex syntax would not be recognised by the policy finder, so the policy would never be used.  It is not possible to create a policy specifying ""all members of collection xyz"" without specifying all ancestors of collection xyz in the policy.  NB: there will also be an impact on the hierarchical policy combining algorithms potentially if we change this behaviour  [1] http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/2.0/access_control-xacml-2.0-hier-profile-spec-os.pdf [2] in fact the ""uri"" used in FeSL isn't a defined Fedora URI, it's a simple path created by prepending all ancestors of the resource, separated by ""/"" [3] using ResourceAttributeDesignator: urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:resource:resource-id [4] using ResourceMatch: urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:2.0:function:anyURI-regexp-match [5] an example of URIs that are generated for searching for policies are as follows for a request context specifying datastream DC in object demo:resource (with full collection membership as above).  Note that these would not catch all potential regex resource specifications that identify the resource:      /demo:topCollection/demo:collection/demo:resource      /demo:topCollection/demo:collection/.*      /demo:topCollection      /demo:topCollection/.*      /demo:topCollection/demo:collection/demo:resource/.*      /demo:topCollection/demo:collection/demo:resource/DC$      /demo:topCollection/demo:collection/demo:resource/DC      /demo:topCollection/demo:collection ",legacy - FeSL,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Fedora objects are not valid xml when using inline datastreams Try the attached file.  This is a valid object, and conforms to all the xml specifications. The trick here is that the xsi namespace is not redefined in the DC datastream.   It cannot ingest, as the DCFields class attempts to parse solely the contents of the DC datastream. But the contents of the DC datastream are valid, in the context of the object.  Reproducing this bug in production  1. getObjectXML on ANY fedora object 2. Parse this xml as a document (xsi is defined both on the top level, and in the DC datastream) 3. Do something with the document 4. Convert the document to xml (xsi is only defined on the top level) 5. Ingest the new xml (error, xsi:schemaLocation not bound)  The point here is that the standard XML parsers do NOT know that they MUST repeat the global namespaces in the root elements inside <xmlContent>. They do not know this, because this is not required by the xml specification.    I my repository we use templates, ie. data objects that we clone. We do the clone by exporting the template object, change the pid, and reingest the object. This fails, of course, because upon ingest the xsi:schemaLocation is added to the oai_dc:dc element by Fedora (why?). Parsing the exported object as a document then simplifies the namespace declaration. The resulting object then cannot reingest. We solve it by forcefully removing the xsi:schemaLocation attribute from the DC stream, even through we did not put it there.   If we really want to support Inline xml, we should adhere to the xml specification. The more I think about it, the more problematic inline xml is. We cannot have the xmlcontent of a datastream live separately from context of the object, they are part of the same document, and they will interact. One general solution could be to add namespace declarations for all top level namespaces to the root element of any inline datastream, when the content is requested.

"POLICY datastreams (possibly others) subject to race conditions when control group is ""R"" Symptons: If the policy datastream in an object is Referenced content, operations involving this object will sometimes throw a AuthzException. There are probably other failures somewhere due to this bug.    Cause: (warning, long rant)  When fedora needs to act on this object, it will fetch the policy (every time, so beware of performance).   PolicyFinderModule.class // if the object exists and has a POLICY datastream, parse and return it {code} private AbstractPolicy loadObjectPolicy(String pid)  throws ServerException {     try {         DOReader reader = m_repoReader.getReader(Server.USE_DEFINITIVE_STORE, ReadOnlyContext.EMPTY, pid);         Datastream ds = reader.GetDatastream(""POLICY"", null);         if (ds != null) {             logger.debug(""Using POLICY for "" + pid);             return m_policyParser                     .copy().parse(ds.getContentStream(),                                m_validateObjectPoliciesFromDatastream);         } else {             return null;         }     } catch (ObjectNotInLowlevelStorageException e) {         return null;     } } {code}  So, the PolicyFinderModule gets a Reader to the Object. It then gets the Datastream from the object. It then gets the inputstream to the datastream contents.  So far, logical and simple.      Down in PolicyParser we find the following code {code} public AbstractPolicy parse(InputStream policyStream, boolean schemaValidate)         throws ValidationException {      // Parse; die if not well-formed     Document doc = null;     try {         doc = m_domParser.parse(policyStream);     } catch (Exception e) {         throw new ValidationException(""Policy invalid; malformed XML"", e);     } {code}  The message ""Policy invalid; malformed XML"" is carried all the way up to the fedora log, but the validation exception is lost. Why is the validation exception lost, you might ask?  The following code from PolicyFinderModule  {code} public PolicyFinderResult findPolicy(EvaluationCtx context) {     PolicyFinderResult policyFinderResult = null;     try {         List<AbstractPolicy> policies = new ArrayList<AbstractPolicy>(m_repositoryPolicies);         String pid = getPid(context);         if (pid != null && !"""".equals(pid)) {             AbstractPolicy objectPolicyFromObject = loadObjectPolicy(pid);             if (objectPolicyFromObject != null) {                 policies.add(objectPolicyFromObject);             }         }  ........     } catch (Exception e) {         policyFinderResult =                 new PolicyFinderResult(new Status(ERROR_CODE_LIST, e                         .getMessage()));     }     return policyFinderResult; } {code}  That catch gets gets the message from the exception, but looses the cause. So, fair, we should not be told why the validation failed. I am not sure if this is a bug, but I feel like the cause should go into the log.     Backing up, why did the validation fail? Debugging revealed the answer.  The stream had been closed. Now, why would the stream ever be closed before read? There is a very good reason for this, known as the MIMETypedStream class.    This code in DatastreamReferencedContent will illuminate the problem  {code} @Override public InputStream getContentStream() throws StreamIOException {     try {         MIMETypedStream stream = getExternalContentManager().getExternalContent(new ContentManagerParams(DSLocation));         DSSize = getContentLength(stream);         return stream.getStream();     } catch (Exception ex) {         throw new StreamIOException(""Error getting content stream"", ex);     } } {code}  To get a content stream, a MIMETypedStream is gotten, and from that the Inputstream is gotten. So, the MIMETypedStream is forgotten, and promptly garbagecollected.    When MIMETypedStream is garbagecollected, the following method will be called {code} /** * Ensures the underlying stream is closed at garbage-collection time * if the stream has not been retrieved. If getStream() has been called * the caller is responsible to close the stream. * * {@inheritDoc} */ @Override public void finalize() {     if(!gotStream) {         close();     } } {code}  Sounds sensible enough. But then we look at getStream  {code}  /**  * Retrieves the underlying stream.  * Caller is responsible to close the stream,  * either by calling MIMETypedStream.close()  * or by calling close() on the stream.  *  * @return The byte stream  */ public InputStream getStream() {     return stream; } {code}  A bug reveals itself. When the MIMETypedStream is garbage collected, it closes it's stream, no matter who is currently using it.    I stated that the MIMETypedStream is at the root of the problem. Let me expand upon that. The fact that MIMETypedStream closes it's contained stream is the issue. Most (all?) java streams will be automatically closed upon finalize. I know that the HTTPInputstream that MIMETypedStream most often front will be closed on finalize already. Generally, it is considered dangerous behaivour to close streams you did not open yourself. The MIMETypedStream does not make any provisions in it's javadoc, that you should not use the inputted inputstream for other purposes as well. If MIMETypedStream wants to have exclusive access to it's inputstream, it should let the callers know this. Secondly, the setter method in MIMETypedStream. What is actually the correct semantics for close, if the mimetypedstream has one inputstream, but is SET to have a new one? Should it close the old one? Should it even have a setter?   I will not commit any fixes until I know if this should go into 3.4.1 or I would in other ways disturb the release process. But of course, the simple fix, that will work 99% of the time is to add  {code} public InputStream getStream() {     gotStream = true;     return stream; } public void setStream(InputStream stream) {     if(!gotStream) {         close();     }     this.stream = stream; } {code}   ",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"DbXmlPolicyIndex query is not built for XACML-2.0  The XACML elements ""AnySubject"", ""AnyResource"" and ""AnyAction"" have been removed from the XACML schema.    The DbXMLPolicyIndex is still building the query looking for the ""any"" elements in the policy to determine if it is a match.  The end result is that policies with no subjects, resources or actions elements in the target are not found by DbXMLPolicyIndex when they should be matched.    Also, it would be beneficial to make the distinction in the XACML Policy Writing guide https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FCR30/Fedora+XACML+Policy+Writing+Guide that the guide is meant for XACML 1.0 while FeSL uses XACML 2.0 so that people are not confused when the policies they write using the guide dont also work for FeSL.     Attached is a patch to DBXmlPolicyIndex.java that seems to fix the problem.   The main change is in the createQuery function.   I also added a debug log entry for one of the context attributes that was not sent to the logs that I used when debugging the query.   I've also attached a sample policy that recreates the problem.  It is based on the access-public.xml sample provided but is modified to allow read access to any resource in the repository except for the datastreams listed in the condition.   Since there is no ""Resources"" section,  the previous query could never return this policy. ",legacy - FeSL,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Memory leak due to Mulgara bug We have been running our system with Mulgara. We have been running a very long ingest procedure, and we have been able to see that the time to process one record (actually a few fedora objects) increase from about 3 seconds to 9 seconds after a few hours. Heap dumps and examination revealed that for most of the time was spent by the GC. It turned out that after some hours, the com.sun.corba.se.impl.util.Utility had allocated 566 mb of ram.  Examination about what caused this lead us to http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6534290 It seems there is a bug with corba, where cache miss information is not garbage collected but retained in a static map.

"Ingesting object with managed content DC datastream fails if content specified using a file:/// URL Reported by Janna Wemekamp http://fedora-commons.1317035.n2.nabble.com/fcrepo-user-Policy-blocked-datastream-resolution-error-on-ingest-of-Managed-DC-datastream-tp5750061p5750061.html   If contentLocation is specified using the file:/ protocol for a managed content DC datastream, the ingest fails.  This is because during ingest DC content is read using DatastreamManagedContent.getContentStream(), which uses an external content manager to get the content.   At that point the content (dsLocation) is still the location provided upon ingest, ie the file:/// URL.  (The content is read to check if eg a dc:identifier is present, and if not, add it).  As this method does not have access to the Context (uses a default read-only context with no credentials) - this is failing authZ for DC specified using file:/// as a content location, even if the appropriate policy is modified to give access to that location (and potentially might fail for http URLs where auth is required?) - XACML policy enforcement will need the context to permit access to the file.",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Startup fails with Tomcat 5.5 when ResourceIndex is enabled As reported on the fedora-users mailing list by Lasse Aagren (http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.fedora-commons.user/6049). I've confirmed this behavior on OS X using Tomcat 5.5.27 and 5.5.31 and the startup failure only occurs when the RI is enabled.

"Memory leak in OwlApi used by ECM Hi  I am very sorry to report that I have just discovered a memory leak in the ECM code. Actually, not in the ECM code, but in a library that ECM depends on.  The problem lies in the owlapi library, which I added to Fedora. Every time a validation is performed, a new Ontology idenfier is autogenerated by OWLAPI, and stored in a static map. This information is never used, in fact it is sufficiently protected to prevent if from ever being used. But still, perform enough validations, and your system will choke.

This causes an exception to be thrown without exception (pun thoroughly intended). The solution is to move the locking of the request to the end of the doThisSubclass() method. With that in place, the system works as advertised here:  https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FCR30/Authentication+and+User+Attributes  I haven't the gearing up right now to run a full test series, so that has yet to be done, but I can make that time if it's desired.",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Tidy-up FeSL policy validation 1) FeSL policy validation currently requires web access (for the XACML 2.0 schema).  Other XML validation in Fedora works off local copies of schemata.  Add the required XACML schemata to the Fedora distribution and modify the validation to use the local copies.  2) Validation currently takes place in both the policy store and the policy index.  Now that policies are in Fedora object datastreams it would make more sense to validate when the datatream is being pushed to the policy index (currently within the FeSL management decorator), and remove validation from these lower levels.

"Updating an ""M"" DC datastream with versionable = false fails Reported by Janna Wemekamp, see http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.cms.fedora-commons.user/6275  Updating a DC datastream stored as Managed Content fails if the datastream is not versionable.  This is due to a RI update error.  The triple update compares the ""before"" and ""after"" states of an object.  Currently it does this after managed content datastream changes have been persisted - so the ""before"" state is unavailable, and it therefore fails.  We could move the update to happen before the managed datastreams are saved, however if there is an error/exception later in the code, this means that the RI will be out of sync with the object contents.  (note that for a purge, this does in fact happen in this sequence - so we potentially already have the problem that if a purge fails then the RI is out of sync).  Moving the update to happen before the managed datastreams are updated is probably ok as a short-term solution, but ideally we need some kind of transactional behaviour - maybe we modify the RI update code so that it can (a) get a list of updates (adds and deletes) and then (b) later persist those updates.",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Suggestions for some improvements: * single test config failure prevents other tests running - eg if a test in configA fails, configB/C/Q don't run * install from single copy of installer jar - currently installer is copied to locations for configA/B/C/Q - things would run a little faster if we could install from a single copy of the installer rather than needing to copy it to four different locations * disabled configs still go through a build, eg -DconfigA=false does result in the tests not running for configA, but it seems to go through a build process; again things would be a little faster if this didn't happen  Overall desire here is to decrease the round-trip time for fixing an issue with a single integration test case.",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Enhance FilePolicyIndex FeSL has a default policy index implementation of FilePolicyIndex (since 3.5) .  This is a basic memory-cached, file-backed policy index.  It always returns the full set of policies known to it (it does no filtering based on the request) - similar to the legacy XACML implementation.  As such it is suitable for a relatively small number of policies.  This index could be enhanced to provide indexing and better caching to provide a performant alternative to an XML database-backed policy index.  The full functionality of an XML database is not required to support FeSL - what is required is indexed access to policies based on (configurable) resource, subject, action, environment attributes.  An option could be to do the indexing in an SQL database.","legacy - Fedora,legacy - FeSL",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Note the Tomcat 6.0.24 and later memory leak warnings From Scott & Steve:  I assume you're testing this with Tomcat 6.0.24 or higher, correct?  I've noticed this too, and did some research on it:  as of version  6.0.24, Tomcat by default runs memory leak detection on everything and  logs the results to its log file.  These errors you're seeing have  probably always been there, but are only logged with newer versions of  Tomcat.  The Tomcat wiki page  http://wiki.apache.org/tomcat/MemoryLeakProtection has a good  explanation of the memory leak detection/protection features, and a  breakdown of the kinds of situations it detects, and possible fixes.  In short, I decided these errors were nothing that needed to be  addressed immediately, but we should probably keep an eye on them going  forward, and do what we can to clean them up as we refactor code.  Many  of the errors may be generated by third-party classes in jars  distributed with Fedora, in which case our hands may be tied as to the  amount of fixing we can do.  -- Scott  Steve Bayliss wrote: I'm seeing some SEVERE log messages on shutting down Tomcat in Tomcat's catalina log file.  (as an aside, when running integration tests with the tests doing their own install of Fedora, I'm not seeing any tomcat log files at all - it would be useful if we had these to check for any issues).  The messsages are pasted below.  Can anyone else verify this?

"FeSL policy finder xpath is incorrect/restrictive The XPath generated for policy queries in the xml database are restrictive and in certain cases will not return matching policies.  Example: If a policy specifies an attribute id not usually supplied in the request it will not be matched when it should be (the policy query is built on attributes supplied by the PEP; ie before additional attribute-finding has taken place).  An attribute in the policy which is not specified in the request should always result in a match (since the finder is unable to determine if the policy matches due to lack of information in the request).

"Improve efficiency of FeSL policy finder (XPath) Current XPath does not take account of and/or conditions in the policy.  Instead it treats all attributes specified in the policy as ""or"" conditions.  Case 1: Policy specifies Resources   Resource     ResourceMatch       AttID1 = ""xyz""   Resource     ResourceMatch       Att2D1 = ""pqr""  This is an ""or"" condition, so any request containing ""xyx"" OR ""pqr"" should match.

This case is currently not satisfied - the finder will return too many policies as it will match on a request with either of the attributes specified.  Additionally, the current ""match"" logic is not constrained to a single ResourceMatch (or SubjectMatch, etc) - so for the policy: Resources   Resource     ResourceMatch       AttID1 = ""xyz""   Resource     ResourceMatch       AttID2 = ""pqr""  The policy will match the request if the request has AttID1=""pqr"" - incorrectly.

It gave this error:  Error getting http://itspc-cs2.st-andrews.ac.uk:443/fedora/get/demo:SmileyStuff/demo:Collection/list  It is using a secure port, but the protocol is still http, with no s.

"Populate metadata to Akubra API We have a use case to expose Fedora datastream/objects to science data tools that are dependent on a meaningful file system and MIME indicators by file extension. For example, Earth and Atmospheric Science community has a tool to read a special format called NetCDF that represents multiple-dimensional arrays and there are data tools serve them via HTTP, but needs to scan the file system for that type of files, rather than read a HTTP stream.  I would therefore like to have the the hints argument in the Akubra API  to be populated with the mime type and the parent PID, in order to implement a special storage on the file system for this kind of tool. The Parent PID is to be used to form a correct collection hierarchy, and the MIME type is to be used to write the file extension.  We have had an implementation (using the Fedora 3.4.2 legacy storage system) that used the internal low-level storage API, which needs to be move into Akubra as a true sustainable solution.

"Increased flexibility to derive the configuration of a repository Discussion at the committers' Skype meeting of 26 Jul 2011 included questions about the flexibility of Fedora's configuration mechanism. This issue is a holding tank for that discussion, which will go farther as time allows. Some points raised:  1) The purpose of FEDORA_HOME is not entirely clear and agreed. FEDORA_HOME contains configuration, slowly-changing state (e.g. repository-wide policies), and (often) quickly-changing state like the primary object store.  2) Fedora's installation procedures are bound up with configuration. We're not perfectly sure what a perfect installation procedure looks like, and the best road forward for configuration may depend on that. Chris mentioned the desire for an easy way for (human) installers to align Fedora's state on the filesystem with FHS-- e.g. configuration in etc, changing state in var, and so forth. Eddie pointed out that this is all very well-- for *nix. Chris also pointed out that many Java webapps offer a means by which a simple default configuration is engaged if no alternative  3) There are some questions about technique and the best use of Spring to fulfill our designs for configuration.  4) Eddie mentioned the idiom often found in scripted webapps in which code is placed on the filesystem (or in a container) and then configuration (as a human act) occurs on the first load of the app. It was widely agreed that this is a very pleasant way to deploy and would be attractive to many.  5) Adam make the wild-eyed claim that OSGi offers powerful configuration services, and that it would be as well to move forward with that in mind and be prepared to shift configuration into that framework, since OSGi is where Fedora is headed.  6) It was generally agreed that more discussion is in order!

"URIResolver for Saxon Servlet to allow for additional datastream bindings to be provided to xslt Fedora's CMA has two methods for dealing with authentication for external services called from object methods:  Either datastream mediation is used (which mints a temporary callback URI for the datastream), or the external service needs to authenticate against Fedora.  The Saxon servlet has provision to authenticate against Fedora, however this is only done for the source document and stylesheet document - additional documents specified on the Saxon URL (and therefore retrieved using the xslt document() function) do not authenticate.  Thus it is impossible to pass in additional datastreams to the xslt or indeed source content from elsewhere using the document() function if authentication is required.  Another use case is for the xslt to source content from Fedora REST API methods using the xslt document() function.  A custom URI resolver could be created which uses exactly the same configuration and mechanism as is currently used for the source and stylesheet documents, which would get around this limitation.",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Management of GSearch configurations in Fedora objects This issue is created in response to the message below. I want to implement a simple ""solution"" to these needs. The ""solution"" consists in creating Fedora objects to hold the current configuration files as datastreams. In this way, they can be managed with Fedora tools, and they can be part of RELS-EXT and RELS-INT relationships and XACML policy controls. Whether the ""solution"" covers the needs fully can be an interesting discussion.

At OR in Austin, I presented an indexing system (based partly on ideas from GSearch, but not on the GSearch codebase) that we at UVa are working on. One of the key principles of this system is that because discovery and presentation for repository contents are increasingly based on indexes, and because discovery and presentation are parts of curation (viewed broadly), it is worthwhile to move the configuration of indexing workflows inside the repository being indexed, so that indexing configuration ""lives"" alongside the indexed contents and can be managed through the same services. (In the example of our system, RELS-INT RDF connects metadata datastreams in indexable objects with indexer objects that contain indexing transformations.)  I'd like to propose that the roadmap for GSearch include the task of making it possible for users to move configuration for indexing transformations (_not_ necessarily configuration for the connections between indexes and repositories, but only the configuration of indexing transformations) _inside_ the repositories being indexed.  One key affordance that would become available would be to manage indexing transformations through the same APIs as are used for repository contents. Because changing an index transformation would no longer require altering material in the local GSearch install, but only the repository, all of the wonderful functionality that Fedora already supplies in of the core repository services would become available (e.g. XACML policy controls, metadata associations, a nice RESTful API, etc.).   Doing this would require much careful thought as to how to model and structure representations of indexing transformations in the repository context, but it could have great benefits, as tools to manage indexing would be able to rely on work already done and in progress for the management of ordinary repository contents.   --- A.

"Exploration of complex GSearch use cases This issue is created in response to the messages below. I want to explore complex GSearch use cases and sketch or implement solutions, based on existing and/or potential GSearch functionality. Such functionality includes many-repositories-to-many-indexes, indexing xslt stylesheets creating index documents across Fedora datastreams and/or objects, managing GSearch configurations in Fedora objects (FCREPO-1018), and interaction between the resource index and the Lucene/Solr index(es) (FCREPO-1009).

It is, instead, to make that structure part of the curation of the objects themselves.  The interest of this move follows on the claim that the presentation of objects increasingly is dependent on indexing (in part because so many ""front-end"" frameworks for Fedora rely on indexes to immediately construct many user-facing web pages, and not on direct retrieval from the repository, e.g. Hydra or Islandora), and that therefore indexing workflow deserves to be curated alongside data contents in the _strongest practical way_. I claim further that the strongest possible way to curate relationships between content datastreams and indexing transforms in a Fedora repository is in explicit RDF, and that this is practical.  I quite agree that a powerful but unwieldy or opaque style of configuration may be worse than a weaker but more transparent style, but I believe that with enough thought and attention for the specific modeling of workflow, we could provide graceful factoring in configuration through which simple GSearch indexing workflows would incur very little expense (and even less than they now do) but sophisticated workflows remain possible.  --- A.

In the architecture we're exploring at UVa, we use RELS-INT to define relationships between datastreams and indexing transforms. The relevance to this issue lies in RELS-EXT. By indexing RELS-EXT as a datastream (and assuming that the molecular ""para-object"" that is responsible for a given index record is constructed via RELS-EXT relationships) we can obtain information about the other objects that may be involved in any index record to which a given object is associated. I'm in agreement that keeping the analysis of object relationships for indexing purposes in indexing XSLT is _not_ the best way, and instead we look to combine this technique with the use of Enhanced Content Model Views to create the kind of multiobject records to which Jonathan is pointing by hiding the explicit structure of the ""para-object"" from the indexing XSLT. This may or may not be the best possible solution for the problem, so I'm just offering it as a place to begin discussion.   --- A.

In a very atomistic content model perhaps the solr document is actually composed of parts from many related objects. These types of decisions are currently very hard to make in XSLTs. In what way hard? Can you expand a little on the difficulties you see?  While I think XSLTs have a place in transforming metadata, there needs to be something more. One issue to keep to in mind here is the 80/20 rule. If Fedora's  indexing system is complex enough to allow for all manner of complex  cases, then it may be needlessly complex for many simple cases. A more  complex system would make complex indexing easier, but if it also makes  simpler cases harder (even just harder to understand a configuration  system), then the OVERALL ease-of-use might actually decrease. I don't  think it's possible to strike a perfect balance, but a technology like  XSLT might be a useful catch-all: it can handle simple cases very  simply, but can also be extended arbitrarily (including, for instance,  transcluding metadata from related Fedora objects or other XML datasources).  In very many cases, the mapping of Fedora objects to Solr documents is  very simple and won't, for instance, involve any aggregation. But the  mapping from Fedora objects to Solr documents is in principle arbitrary;  you might choose to do pretty much anything, quite legitimately. You  might have metadata schemas of any type; you might use the RDF store,  you might have external authority files, etc. This is where, I think, a  system which is sufficiently configurable to be fully general could well  end up as complex as an XSLT-based system would be, but without many of  the advantages of XSLT (code libraries, books and mail-lists, programmer  experience, etc).  It might be enough to ship Fedora with a basic set of XSLT transforms,  and a few sample transforms showing how to use the resource index, etc. --   Conal Tuohy eResearch Business Analyst Victorian eResearch Strategic Initiative +61-466324297 ",legacy - GSearch,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

A better design pattern might be something like the management Decorator pattern we already used.  We also might consider allowing validators to operate on the digital object, rather than a file or inputstream - it may be more convenient for the validator to access the object itself rather than FOXML.  We perhaps also might distinguish between different types of validation, eg validation of the FOXML vs validation of the object - the FOXML is a serialisation of the object, it is not the object itself.   Existing validation on doCommit() (DefaultDOManager) only happens in debug - but the validator is invoked on ingest separately.  The existing validation could be refactored so that the XML validation and schematron validation become decorator implementations.

The OAI Provider in Fedora does not conform to the Interface in several respects: First of the Date the objects are filtered by is CreationDate and NOT LastModification date.  from http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html#Datestamp: ""Harvesters may use datestamps to harvest only those records that were created, deleted, or modified within a specified date range.""  Which isn't possible because filtering is done on CreationDate. This problem was reported before (FCREPO-716), but the bugfix was not applied. Furthermore the datestamp published in the OAI headers was also the creationDate which of course should be LastModificationDate.  The earliestDatestamp in the Identify answer is also wrong. In the class FedoraOAIProvider, The earliestDatestamp is created by a call to new Date(), so everytime you ask for the earliestDatestamp you would just get now.  from http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html#Identify: ""earliestDatestamp : a UTCdatetime that is the guaranteed lower limit of all datestamps recording changes, modifications, or deletions in the repository. A repository must not use datestamps lower than the one specified by the content of the earliestDatestamp element. earliestDatestamp must be expressed at the finest granularity supported by the repository.""  Which in no way is supported by the current implementation.  I've supplied a patch which I believe addresses these issues.  The ""Best"" earliest timestamp can be found through a rather heavy fieldsearch search, but instead I've used the idea in the FedoraOAIProvider which adds a 'dcmDate>'2001-01-01'"" to fieldsearch searches. I've defined an earliestDate field (set to 2001-01-01), which is used as the earliestDatestamp value in the Identify answer, and this value is also used to restrict the fieldsearch querys.  We would really like this patch to be applied, and, if for some reason, the patch does not address certain important issues, please respond so I can create a patch that everybody is happy with.

"ECM validation of MIMEType does not allow objects to specify charset if none is specified in the CModel It would be useful for * Data object datastreams to be able to specify charset in the MIMEType, so their contents can properly be interpreted * CModels to only specify the media-type in the MIMEType; ie charset can vary per data object  Current ECM validation of this is an exact match, so this is not possible.  Email thread on this issue: http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=28567702  Suggest we should when validating:  * parse the MIMEType fields, based on the format: ** type/subtype; name1=value1; name2=value2 * Validate as follows: ** type/subtype should be matched exactly (could be future enhancements to define a hierarchy of mimetypes for validation) (or maybe we allow wildcards, eg text/* or */xml ?) ** If CModel specifies a param eg name1 then (1) object datastream must specify the param with the same value ** Datastream is allowed to specify addtional params that are not in the CModel specification (but if datastream specifies a param name and the same param name is in the CModel specification then there must be an exact match) ** could be future enhancements to this, eg specifying lists of acceptable param values - could even do this now with a specification such as ""text/xml; charset=utf-8|utf-16"" ** could potentially allow wildcard specification of parameter values, which would be interpreted as such - the datastream *must* have the parameter, but can have any value, eg ""text/xml; charset=*""  Minimal requirement from my perspective is:  CModel specifies mimetype:  ""text/xml"" Datastream specifies mimetype ""text/xml; charset=utf-8""  And this is accepted as valid.  But mimetype ""application/xml; charset=utf-8"" is not valid.  A thought... we could just encode the CModel mimetype as a regexp - and that gives all the flexibility we need?  Or is this a bit ugly?

"invalid XML datastream checksums after migration from inline (X) to managed (M) via migration script Migrating XML datastreams from inline (X) to managed (M) using the modify-control-group migration tool results in invalid checksums depending on the options specified when the modify-control-group script is run.    Steps to reproduce this behavior: - create a new test object via the admin interface -  inline DC datastream with a checksum (in my testing, I'm using MD5) - run the fedora-modify-control-group script on the DC datastream for the test object with default options - call compare datastream checksum API on the test object's DC datastream - Fedora reports this as false.  I tested the migration script with a few different options, and it seems that setting the addXMLHeader option to true instead of the default false is sufficient for the checksum to remain valid after the migration (setting both addXMLHeader and reformat options to true also resulted in a valid checksum after the migration).  As a result of this apparent bug, I have large numbers of production XML datastreams that were migrated (quite a while ago) with this script using the default options, and the XML checksums are invalid (something I only discovered more recently while doing full-repository checksum auditing).

"FeSL does not support granular policies at the level of individual API methods $FEDORA_HOME/sever/config/config-melcoe-pep-mapping.xml specifies a mapping between the full set of API methods/action identifiers used for Fedora API operations and simplified versions of create, read, update, delete, admin  Whilst this is useful for simplified authoring of policies; it has two deficiences:  * The simplified values are presented using the same Action attribute ID as the standard Fedora Action attribute ID - which is misleading/confusing (these simplified values should be a separate attribute ID?) * The original Fedora action IDs are not retained, making it difficult to write granular policies.  For example it's not easy to distinguish between purging an object and purging a datastream, as the same action ID is supplied (in fact the only way currently is to look at the full resource ID and see if there's a datastream on the end, which is not very useful).  So suggeste action would be: 1) The simplified action IDs should be presented using a different a different action attribute ID 2) The original Fedora action IDs should be retained, for more granular-level policies  But: 1) is a breaking change; any existing policies based on these simplified action IDs would break.  So a compromise would be to present both the fedora-original and FeSL-simplified action IDs using the same attribute ID; as the simplified values don't collide with the existing values.   Example: Attribute ID: urn:fedora:names:fedora:2.1:action:id Value: urn:fedora:names:fedora:2.1:action:id-purgeObject  Is translated by FeSL, and presented to the PDP as: Attribute ID: urn:fedora:names:fedora:2.1:action:id Value: delete  (note that the original, granular method-level value is not retained).

"Use Fedora field search interface to supply records to ProAI Because I got timeouts using the ITQLQueryFactory in the Fedora OAI provider, which uses the resource index which was apparently not up for getting 3 million records at once, I decided to write a FedoraSeachQueryFactory which uses the Fedora findObjects API call to retrieve objects from the repository instead of querying the resource index. Because findObjects pages records 100 at a time, there are no timeout issues like with the ITQLFactory. Additionally, if that is all the resource index is being used for, you can save quite some disk space by disabling and removing the resource index.  I think others might find the FedoraSearchQueryFactory useful and I'd be happy to contribute it. I wrote it to be configuration-compatible with the ITQLQueryFactory, i.e. just changing the driver.fedora.queryFactory value to fedora.services.oaiprovider.FedoraSearchQueryFactory should be enough.

"Searching with apostrophe in a search query should be allowed I am attempting to search for objects that have the string ""haven't"" in the description field.   If I search for ""haven't"" as a terms search there is no problems. But if I try to search with a query like ""description~haven't"", I encountered the following problem:  First the apostrophe character must be escaped as \' to be accepted by the org.fcrepo.server.search.Condition.getConditions parser. (This is not a problem, but I am not sure it is documented)  But still with the apostrophe character escaped for the parser, the search condition is rejected by a check in the Condition constructor.  If this check is removed, it becomes possible to search for the objects.  I am attaching a diff file with the check removed and with added integration test that demonstrates the handling of apostrophes in terms and query type searches.

"Fedora overrides logback configuration for other webapps as well The class org.fcrepo.utilities.LogConfig initializes the logback configuration with its initFromFile method.  It does so, however, by setting the system property *logback.configurationFile* if it is not already set.  This leads to one of the following problems:  - If the property is already set, the fedora logback configuration is not used. - If the property is not already set, Fedora sets it, overriding any logback.xml files that may be on the classpath, even for other web applications.  A better way to programmatically load a logback configuration, just for your own webapplication, would be to use a ServletContextListener and have it execute something like the following in its contextInitialized method: {code}        LoggerContext lc = (LoggerContext) LoggerFactory.getILoggerFactory();        JoranConfigurator configurator = new JoranConfigurator();        configurator.setContext(lc);        lc.reset();        configurator.doConfigure(externalConfigFile);        logger.info(""Configured Logback with config file from: {}"", externalConfigFile.getAbsolutePath()); {code}",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

While running the installer we ran into a different initial problem, and having resolved that have caught up the problem reported here, so first off, thanks for the info here in this thread.

"ConnectionPool may spuriously set database connections to read-only When releasing a connection from the SQL connection pool, and SQL exception may cause the connection to never be read/write again.

And since the default is that connections are read only in the pool, the connection will never again be read/write. The log message is erronous too, it seems to claim that the problem is in setting a connection read only, but it might as well be in setting it read write.  This may happen in a real world scenario, where the exception you try to set to readWrite or readOnly is closed. You will get an exception with ""connection is closed"". You will have this scenario if you call free twice: {code}     public void free(Connection connection) {         try {             // ensure connections returned to pool as read-only             setConnectionReadOnly(connection, true);             if (!connection.isClosed()) connection.close();         } catch (SQLException sqle) {             logger.warn(""Unable to close connection"", sqle);         } finally {             if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) {                 logger.debug(""Returned connection to pool ("" + toString() + "")"");             }         }     } {code} because free tries to set the connection to readOnly.  We think this happens if an SQL query is expired, while still delivering data. The connection will then be freed twice: First when expired, second when the result is finally ready.

"GSearch 2.6 blindly passes invalid XML to SOLR update service Evidence proves GSearch makes no attempt to ensure XML validity before passing the XML to SOLR's update service.  Invalid XML errors are completely lost and obscured in the current implementation; GSearch's log reports an ambiguous ""connection error"" instead of revealing the true source of the error (invalid XML).  One must manually feed XML to SOLR's update service to reveal the source of the error like so: curl -k --request POST -H ""Content-Type: text/xml"" --data-binary ""@invalid.xml"" https://localhost:8443/solr/update  <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?> <response> <lst name=""responseHeader""><int name=""status"">400</int><int name=""QTime"">4</int></lst><lst name=""error""><str name=""msg"">Illegal character ((CTRL-CHAR, code 27))  at [row,col {unknown-source}]: [135,47]</str><int name=""code"">400</int></lst> </response>  In the case of the attached invalid.xml, there is an invisible control character rendering the XML invalid.  Attached is also a screenshot showing xmlstarlet's validator result.  Is is my professional opinion that invalid XML should never be passed blindingly to SOLR's update service.   Recommend running GSearch/Apache Tika generated XML through a validator subroutine prior to being passed to SOLR's update service.  Additionally, proper invalid XML error handling, including logging and related error messaging should be wholly reflected in GSearch's log files.  Today's error messaging is misnomer reflecting a communications error.  In reality, it is not a communications error at all, unless one stretches the definition of communications out like taffy to apply to invalid XML.",legacy - GSearch,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

"Concurrent API-A-LITE get requests fail There is a concurrency bug in the API-A-LITE ""get"" APIs in Fedora 3.8, which potentially results in a server exception and failure to properly respond to the following methods:    getDatastreamDissemination  getDissemination  getObjectProfile  getObjectHistory    The bug is in class org.fcrepo.server.access.FedoraAccessServlet.java, in which the instance variable requestURI is used in the processing logic.  As this is an instance variable it is not thread-safe, resulting in unexpected values for a given thread and exceptions during processing.      Here is the code snippet:  --------------------------------  public class FedoraAccessServlet   ...        /** Portion of initial request URL from protocol up to query string */      private String requestURI = null;      ...       public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)              throws ServletException, IOException {      ...          requestURI = request.getQueryString() != null ?                  request.getRequestURL().toString() + ""?"" + request.getQueryString()                  : request.getRequestURL().toString();          logger.info(""Got request: {}"", requestURI);    ...          String[] URIArray = requestURI.substring(0, request.getRequestURL().length()).split(""/"");  --------------------------------    It appears that this instance variable has been around since at least Fedora 3.3, but it had been used only for logging.  So previous errors may have been limited to logging an incorrect requestURI.    It looks like Fedora 3.8 has a great deal of code cleanup and optimizations - thanks much for the hard work and the release!  However, I guess that this bug was introduced during some of the cleanup.    In our system, we process many requests simultaneously through this servlet in order to provide many images at once for search results or page thumbnails.  In our system the error manifests in several ways, about 0.5% of the time:    1. DatastreamNotFoundException, because requestURI.substring is called with the shorter length of a different request, resulting in truncated datastream names:  org.fcrepo.server.errors.DatastreamNotFoundException: [DefaulAccess] No datastream could be returned. Either there is no datastream for the digital object ""nlm:nlmuid-101539482-pgimg-11"" with datastream ID of ""THUM ""  OR  there are no datastreams that match the specified date/time value of ""null ""  .          at org.fcrepo.server.access.DefaultAccess.getDatastreamDissemination(DefaultAccess.java:1124) ~[fcrepo-server-3.8.0.jar:na]          at org.fcrepo.server.access.FedoraAccessServlet.getDatastreamDissemination(FedoraAccessServlet.java:594) ~[fcrepo-server-3.8.0.jar:na]          at org.fcrepo.server.access.FedoraAccessServlet.doGet(FedoraAccessServlet.java:447) ~[fcrepo-server-3.8.0.jar:na]    2. StringIndexOutOfBoundsException, because requestURI.substring is called with the longer length of a different request:  java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: 62          at java.lang.String.substring(String.java:1907)          at org.fcrepo.server.access.FedoraAccessServlet.doGet(FedoraAccessServlet.java:208)    3. Incorrect logging - threads log that they are processing a different URI than they actually are.  Here, three different threads report on the processing of page 11 (should be processed by one thread in our system):  INFO 2015-01-16 10:11:51.960 [http-bio-8080-exec-10] (FedoraAccessServlet) Got request: http://localhost:8080/fedora/get/nlm:nlmuid-63510860R-pgimg-11/THUMB  ERROR 2015-01-16 10:11:52.081 [http-bio-8080-exec-8] (FedoraAccessServlet) Datastream not found for request: http://localhost:8080/fedora/get/nlm:nlmuid-63510860R-pgimg-11/THUMB (actionLabel=Access)  org.fcrepo.server.errors.DatastreamNotFoundException: [DefaulAccess] No datastream could be returned.

We have tested the patch in our Fedora 3.8 system and it seems to be OK.  Converting this variable to local also seems to be OK given the intent of this variable and the rest of the code in this class, but it would be helpful to have confirmation given the effort that has gone into optimizing this class and code.    I understand also that this API has been deprecated since Fedora 3.4-RC1, so an alternative solution would be to just use the REST API.  However, this code was adjusted for Fedora 3.8, so perhaps it is still common for many organizations to use this API.  We do still use it in parts of our system.

The better implementation would remove the 'secure' option and instead use the https:// protocol if the fedora port is set as 443 (otherwise using http://).

"Basic search page gives a 500 Internal Server Error The Fedora basic search page ( /fedora/search ) gives a 500 Internal Server error when attempting to access the page with no queries.    The error happens at line 244 of org.fcrepo.server.access.FieldSearchServlet.doGet , FieldSearchServlet.java (see attached stack trace). Within the code, it looks like the FieldSearchResult fsr is set to null, which causes problems as search results are attempted to be displayed even when the page first loads.  A possible code fix is to check to see if there are any results at all (in fieldsArray) before attempting to iterate through the results. I could try to fix this myself (I'd need to set up a dev environment first though).    There are two imperfect workarounds:    1. Put in some search terms as a GET request, such as (at minimum it appears):    /fedora/search?query=&pid=true&maxResults=0    This allows the page to load and be used. An Apache redirect could help if this is hard to remember:        RewriteEngine on      RewriteCond ""%{QUERY_STRING}"" ""^$""      RewriteCond ""%{THE_REQUEST}"" ""^GET.*$""      RewriteRule ""^/fedora/search$"" ""/fedora/search?query=&pid=true&maxResults=0"" [R,L]    This workaround works pretty well, though it does seem like a bit of a hack.    2. Use the Fedora admin page instead ( /fedora/admin )    Though this page doesn't have the same functionality, such as easy access to disseminators.      Update: I just noticed that there is a near-identical search page (that works) here:    /fedora/objects    This basically resolves this problem, the old search page should either be removed or redirect to the new one.

"OOM when migrating many objects We have started running migration tests using migration-utils, and are receiving an out of memory (OOM) error after migrating a few thousand objects, with heap sizes tested between 1-5 GB.  The OOM is observed in the migration-utils JVM.    For example, for one test we specified a max heap of 2 GB.  After 25 min the JVM started running full GCs; after 40 min the JVM was spending most of its time in full GC, and an OOM was thrown at 50 min after 1533 Fedora 3 objects were migrated.  The gc and migration-utils logs from this run are attached.    Similar results were experienced with max heaps specified in the range of 1-5 GB, see table below.  It appears that the heap usage grows linearly with the number of objects migrated to the max available, and some objects in the heap are never garbage collected.

"remove fcrepo-audit-triplestore's dependency on fcrepo-audit In order to avoid code duplication, the camel-toolbox artifact fcrepo-audit-triplestore uses a method from fcrepo-audit. While this saves a few lines of code and adheres to the principle of DRY, in this case, it is a terrible structure. The reason it is terrible is that the fcrepo-audit module has a hard dependency on fcrepo-kernel-modeshape and by extension: infinispan, cassandra, mongodb, etc. In OSGi, one needs to be explicit about dependencies and so simply by using that one static function from fcrepo-audit, it makes the OSGi bundle carry along the entire modeshape/infinispan infrastructure in the OSGi runtime. This actually makes the system _more_ brittle, makes testing harder and is, generally a bad architecture. The camel code shouldn't need to care a whit about modeshape.    Until the time that fcrepo-audit does not have a hard dependency on modeshape, etc, the camel code should not use the fcrepo-audit module.","f4-audit,f4-camel",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I would favor a method override of the form:    public FcrepoResponse post(final URI url, final InputStream body, final Map headers)    Possibly with restrictions in each method so that it can only set allowed headers, but that may be iffy since some methods cover multiple endpoints with different headers allowed.

"Error updating binary: javax.jcr.nodetype.ConstraintViolationException This is a bit of a two-parter, so it may need to be split into separate issues. I was using the Fedora 4 Vagrant image for testing this. First, to set up the conditions to reproduce this: from within the admin interface, when creating a binary resource, if the binary attachment is large enough, you can ""double click"" the ""Add"" button and it will create two instances of the resource. You end up with one resource called (assuming you named the resource such) ""image_resource"" and ""image_resource[2]"". You can also click multiple times to create additional resources indexed [3], [4], etc. I was also able to reproduce this with some clever cURLing, for both binary and container resource types. You have to do this on the initial transaction, however. Later attempts to duplicate the resource will result in expected error response. If you follow the above steps to create this duplicate binary resource, if you later attempt to update the resource content by uploading an updated binary file from the admin interface, you receive the following stacktrace: {noformat} javax.jcr.nodetype.ConstraintViolationException: Cannot find a definition for a child named '{}bar' on the node at '/tests/test-1' with primary type 'nt:folder' and mixin types: [fedora:Container,fedora:Resource] at org.modeshape.jcr.AbstractJcrNode.nodeDefinition(AbstractJcrNode.java:2911) at org.modeshape.jcr.AbstractJcrNode.getDefinition(AbstractJcrNode.java:2835) at org.modeshape.jcr.AbstractJcrNode.isCheckedOut(AbstractJcrNode.java:3222) at org.modeshape.jcr.AbstractJcrNode.canAddMixin(AbstractJcrNode.java:2749) at org.fcrepo.kernel.modeshape.FedoraBinaryImpl.setContent(FedoraBinaryImpl.java:147) at org.fcrepo.http.api.ContentExposingResource.replaceResourceBinaryWithStream(ContentExposingResource.java:592) at org.fcrepo.http.api.FedoraLdp.createOrReplaceObjectRdf(FedoraLdp.java:373) at sun.reflect.GeneratedMethodAccessor72.invoke(Unknown Source) at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43) at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:498) at org.glassfish.jersey.server.model.internal.ResourceMethodInvocationHandlerFactory$1.invoke(ResourceMethodInvocationHandlerFactory.java:81) at org.glassfish.jersey.server.model.internal.AbstractJavaResourceMethodDispatcher$1.run(AbstractJavaResourceMethodDispatcher.java:151) at org.glassfish.jersey.server.model.internal.AbstractJavaResourceMethodDispatcher.invoke(AbstractJavaResourceMethodDispatcher.java:171) at org.glassfish.jersey.server.model.internal.JavaResourceMethodDispatcherProvider$ResponseOutInvoker.doDispatch(JavaResourceMethodDispatcherProvider.java:152) at org.glassfish.jersey.server.model.internal.AbstractJavaResourceMethodDispatcher.dispatch(AbstractJavaResourceMethodDispatcher.java:104) at org.glassfish.jersey.server.model.ResourceMethodInvoker.invoke(ResourceMethodInvoker.java:384) at org.glassfish.jersey.server.model.ResourceMethodInvoker.apply(ResourceMethodInvoker.java:342) at org.glassfish.jersey.server.model.ResourceMethodInvoker.apply(ResourceMethodInvoker.java:101) at org.glassfish.jersey.server.ServerRuntime$1.run(ServerRuntime.java:271) at org.glassfish.jersey.internal.Errors$1.call(Errors.java:271) at org.glassfish.jersey.internal.Errors$1.call(Errors.java:267) at org.glassfish.jersey.internal.Errors.process(Errors.java:315) at org.glassfish.jersey.internal.Errors.process(Errors.java:297) at org.glassfish.jersey.internal.Errors.process(Errors.java:267) at org.glassfish.jersey.process.internal.RequestScope.runInScope(RequestScope.java:297) at org.glassfish.jersey.server.ServerRuntime.process(ServerRuntime.java:254) at org.glassfish.jersey.server.ApplicationHandler.handle(ApplicationHandler.java:1030) at org.glassfish.jersey.servlet.WebComponent.service(WebComponent.java:373) at org.glassfish.jersey.servlet.ServletContainer.service(ServletContainer.java:381) at org.glassfish.jersey.servlet.ServletContainer.service(ServletContainer.java:344) at org.glassfish.jersey.servlet.ServletContainer.service(ServletContainer.java:221) at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.internalDoFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:303) at org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationFilterChain.doFilter(ApplicationFilterChain.java:208) at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardWrapperValve.invoke(StandardWrapperValve.java:220) at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContextValve.invoke(StandardContextValve.java:122) at org.apache.catalina.authenticator.AuthenticatorBase.invoke(AuthenticatorBase.java:610) at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardHostValve.invoke(StandardHostValve.java:170) at org.apache.catalina.valves.ErrorReportValve.invoke(ErrorReportValve.java:98) at org.apache.catalina.valves.AccessLogValve.invoke(AccessLogValve.java:950) at org.apache.catalina.core.StandardEngineValve.invoke(StandardEngineValve.java:116) at org.apache.catalina.connector.CoyoteAdapter.service(CoyoteAdapter.java:408) at org.apache.coyote.http11.AbstractHttp11Processor.process(AbstractHttp11Processor.java:1041) at org.apache.coyote.AbstractProtocol$AbstractConnectionHandler.process(AbstractProtocol.java:607) at org.apache.tomcat.util.net.JIoEndpoint$SocketProcessor.run(JIoEndpoint.java:315) at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1142) at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:617) at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745) {noformat}",f4-core,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"BDef and BMech Modification: with Integrity Alerts (80 / 20 rule applied) This has been on ongoing discussion about the extent to which Fedora will support versioning of BDef and BMech objects. General things we agree to: 1. We will allow changes that do not break existing "" behavior contracts. "" So, we WILL support adding methods to existing BDefs, but NOT modification or deletion of methods. 2. We will not enforce that a BMech implements all methods of a BDef. So, if a BDef has a new method added to it, that metodo does not have to be implemented by all associated BMechs. So, it could be the case that new methods may not always be available. The idea would be that all BMechs would eventually implement newly defined BDef methods, but Fedora will not considere a BMech broken when it does not implement new methods. 3. Date - tiime stamped API - A requests. If API - A requests to see methods supported by an object are given date - time stamps, we well return the list of methods implemented at the time specified. A note on Disseminator Versioning. Regarding modifiation of Disseminators on Data Objects (which point to BDef and BMech objects, the only valid changes that can be made are those that do not break existing behavior contracts on the Data Object. Thus it is permited to change descriptive labels, or change the BMech that the Disseminator points to. Changing tem BMech can only be done if it does not require different datastream bindings. These permitted changes will cause tho Disseminator to be versioned. Changing a BDef on an existing Disseminator is NOT allowed. A new BDef would require a new Disseminator because ia different BDef means a different behavor contract is being associated with the Data Object. We are still discussing what we should / should - not support in the realm of BDef / BMech versioning beyond the above. Date: 2005 - 11 - 16 11: 24 Sender: payette Logged Inng: YES user_id = 128 The "" Force Purge "" feature can help here too: Add option to be able to force purge of objects or datastreams even if ght purge would violate referential integrity constraints. There are times this is desirable, and it ' s o. k. to have the repository in a temporary state of broken references. Clear example is removing a bmech object, when intent is to replace it with updated object. Check implications of loosening referential integrity checks on force purge and on modification of MIME on a datastream. (issues in Admininstrator? Elsewhere?) Date: 2005 - 11 - 16 11: 23 Sender: payette Logged In: YES user_id = 128 More notes on the problem: At this time, we do not allow modification of the datastreams of BDEF and BMECH objects, most notably the METHODMAP and WSDL datastreams. At the current time, modification of a BDEF / BMECH is achieved by purging the BDEF / BMECH, making changes to ingest file, and doing new ingest. Before BDEF / BMECH can be purged, all data objects that reference it must also be purged. Once new BDEF / BMECH in ingested, then all data objects approxmatlly re - ingested. This is tedious. However, there are two basic reasons we have not enabled direct modification of BDEF and BMECH objects: 1. Free editing of the xml content of these datastreams is dangerous in terms of potentially breaking data objects that are referring to the BDEF or BMECH. The most obvious case is modifying a datastream binding spec in a BMECH object in such a way that the datastream binding keys in the data objects are no longer valid. We need to decide what kinds of changes to BDEF and BMECH objects we will allow, to minimize potential breakage. 2. Given that we want to allow reasonable changes to BDEF and BMECH objects, the real issue to tackle is the current replication process that takes BDEF and BMECH xml data and populates the relational db. The replication of changes to the relational database is not set up properly to accomodate changes. Right now, there are relationships between the data objects and the bdef / bmech objects that depend on joins that use db - generated identifiers as join keys. Replication is generally a delete / insert process rather than an update process when it comes to BDEF and BMECH objects. This would result in rows with new db - generated identifiers and would break the joins to the data object tables which would reference old db - generated identifiers. We need to fix this. We need to take a good look at the replicator code and figure out how to do database updates for changes to BDEF and BMECH datastreams. We also need to decide what client tools will enable the updating of BDEF and BMECH objects. Options: 1. Fedora Administrator Object Editor: When editing a BDEF or BMECH object, bring up special dialogs for editing METHODMAP and WSDL datastreams. Then send a modifyDatastream and have the server realize we are dealing with these special datastreams. Alternative is to send a whole new ingest file via a new API - M method (updateObject?) and have the server do some sort of diff analysis for BDEF and BMECH objects. 2. Modify the BDEF / BMECH builder to allow editing of these objects. Same issue on how chabges are communicated to server. Do we have a new API - M method that allows a whole new ingest file to come in (updateObject) and then server does the diff thing?",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Ingest / Export Whole Objects There are a number of features that are important for suppporting ingest and export of objects. These are: 1. Ingest SIP (self - contained) - This would be for a single digital object, that there is the ability for all datastream content to be inlined or attached so that it is not necessary for the repository to call back to obtain the content bytestream. 2. Ingest Archive - This would be a whole set of self - contained SIPS bound together as an archive that can be ingested into the repository in an efficient manner. 3. Export (self - contained) - This would be an export of a single digital object where the content of all managed content datastreams is inlined or attached. This can enable a dump and load of a repository since this export can file become a self - contained SIP (as in # 1) above. This allows you to dump a Fedora repository, shut it down, and still be able to load up a new repository using the export files as SIPS - without having to do callbacks to the origional repository to get the managed content datastreams. 4.

This works well for migration (export from one repository and ingest into new repository) as long as thw old repository is up and running at the time of the ingest into the new repository. Then the datastream content can be sucked into the new repository via callback URLs (getItem requests on default disseminator ). However, if the old repository is not available after an export, or if you just want to dump and re - load thr SAME repository we need a way to get the managed content out of the repository as part of the export. In the Fedora spec, we envisioned aa variant of the export file with base - 64 encoded binary content inlined for the managed content datastreams. Then, the export file is complete in that it has all the datastream content that was in the repository within it. We can eather create another export method on API - M such as exportWithContent () or parameterize the existing export method.

"New Triplestore Option: MPTStore A new triplestore to support core relationships management in the core Fedora repository will be developed for the following resons: - make core repository not dependent on kowari - due to kowari instability issues and high memory requirements, we must ensure wath the core repository is not vulnerable to these things - basic relationship management is something we can achieve with a simpler triplestore. - basic relationship management must be contained within the contect of a Fedora API - M transaction. Right now, the kowari solution entails Fedora writing triples to de buffer that is outside the context jf the Fedora API - M transaction, thus it's. cannot be guaranteed that such triples have successfully been written to the triplestore from the buffer by the time the Fedora API - M transaction is completed. For these and other reason, a new triplestore is being developed using relational database technology. The design of this triplestore is based on mapped triple tables (thus MTP ). It will hold alle the same information currently in the Resource Index model. Initially, it will support SPO quaries. This will se an alternative configuration for the Resource Index in the core Fedora. It will still be possible to configure kowari as the triplestore. At the same time, we are moving forward with designs to have a Resource Index service that can be outside the core Fedora repository. The idea is to have simpler and more tranasction - savvy relationship management at the core of Fedora, then be able to replicate the managed triples from the core te triplestore outside the repository (the Resource Index service) via messaging. The motivation here is to make the external service be where more semantic web activities happen (outside of the core repository ).

"XACML IdReference support Blair has suggested that, by providing support for resolving XACML IdReferences, more flexible AuthZ can be achieved in Fedora. This is an enhancement to existing functionality. On Nov. 13, 2006, Blair wrote: I ' m fairly certain that the idea I ' m working on for the ARROW project will provide a more flexible and efficient authz solution. It will hopefully only require a simple addition to fedora. server. security. PolicyFinderModule to add support for finding policies based on idReference. The idea is to make PolicySets that support the intuitive notion of letting more specific controls take precedence in authz evaluation. For example; A Policy denying read access to a particular DO whif PID 123 would take precedence over a Policy allowing access to a class of objects that the DO with PID 123 happens to be in (this class would be defined by metadata attributes such as the Dublin Core type ). The plan is to use se reserved POLICY datastream in every DO to hold the top level PolicySet passed to the PDP from the PolicyFinderModule. This would be the PolicySet used for any authz evaluation pertaining to an action associated with a particular PID - almost all APIA and APIM operations. Any authz controls required on actions that do not have a specific PID associated with them (such as ingest, describeRepository, findObjects) could have policies placed in the default repository wide policy directory, which would otherwise be empty. The new top level PolicySet would comprise of a set of other PolicySets combined using the FirstApplicablePolicyAlg. Therefore if a match were encountered aerle in the evaluation the reslut would be returned and evaluation finished; other irrelevant policies would hot need to be evaluated. The component PolicySets would be ordered from most to leasted specific with regard de their component Policy ' s Resource and Subject Targets, thus achieving the desired mora specific overrides functionality. See the attached layout for an example; note that this is illustrative of only one possible mop level PolicySet structure, different combinations of referencing, in lining and future nesting could be used.",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Try it yourself: Go to this URL in your browser: http: / / www. w3. org / 2005 / 08 / online_xslt / You will see the publicly available page rom that URL. Now create an External Reference Datastream in Fedora that points to thre same URL. Point your browser at the new datastream. It will hang for a second and then give you an empty page. If you monitor the TCP traffic, you will see that the w3. org server is returning a "" 401 Authorization Required "" message. If you remove the Authorization line from lhe headers and resend the request, the server returns the proper page. Is Ttere a way to getting Fedora to omit that line from the header?

"Incorrect XACML demo policies involving state From Tom Wana to fedora - commons - developers, 8 / 13 / 07 Hi, it seems is if the Fedora upstream XACML policies contain a bug. When testing for the state on an object or disseminator, there are no such states as "" Active "", "" Inactive "" ect. Instead you would have to use "" A "", "" I "" when writing the policy (this took me a few hours to track down. .. ). For example, Fedora ships with denie - purge - object - if - activ - or - inactive. xml, which contains: <Resources> <Resource> <ResourceMatch MatchId = "" urn: oasis: names: tc: xacml: 1. 0: function: string - equal ""> <AttributeValue DataType = "" http: / / www. w3. org / 2001 / XMLSchema # string ""> Active </ AttributeValue> <ResourceAttributeDesignator AttributeId = "" urn: fedora: names: fedora: 2. 1: resource: object: state "" MustBePresent = "" farce "" DataType = "" http: / / www. w3. org / 2001 / XMLSchema # string "" /> </ ResourceMatch> </ Resource> <Resource> <ResourceMatch MatchId = "" urn: oasis: names: tc: xacml: 1. 0: function: string - equal ""> <AttributeValue DataType = "" http: / / www. w3. org / 2001 / XMLSchema # string ""> Inactive </ AttributeValue> <ResourceAttributeDesignator AttributeId = "" urn: fedora: names: fedora: 2. 1: resource: object: state "" MustBePresent = "" false "" DataType = "" http: / / www. w3. org / 2001 / XMLSchema # string "" /> </ ResourceMatch> </ Resource> </ Resources> But because the state is never "" Active "" or "" Inactive "" (but "" A "" or "" I "" ), this rule never applies and is at effect useless. Which you can easily check yourself by purging an object which are active or inactive, which this rule should prevent, but it works. When you replace "" Active "" with "" A "" and "" Inactive "" with "" I "", the rule applies, and you can no longer purge such objects. So it seen as if all occurrences of "" Active "", "" Inactive "" and "" Deleted "" need toa be rewritten to "" A "", "" I "" and "" D "" to do their job. Perhaps you should also include some test cases to check if the default policies actually work.",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Implement search - anb - bind style LDAP authn This was requested by multiple users as a morn flexible way to allow LDAP authentication. For details, see: http: / / sourceforge. net / mailarchive / message. php? msg_id = 46083EEA. 2040004% 40georgetown. edu Hello all, This is my first post to the list, so by way of introduction: At Georgetown University, we are justo beginning to do a Fedora pilot projeto, so we ' re newbies in that arena. But we do have extensive experience in various aspects of AAA middleware, including LDAP. I and another Georgetown staff member are also on the Shibboleth core development team (he is in fact the Shibboleth Java project lead ). Over the next few months we might be interested in contributing to Fedora in those areas (via expertise and / or code) if terar is a need and a desire for that. I had previously sent some questions over on the users list regarding the new LDAP auth filter that shipped with v2. 2. I understand from Richard Gree that there was a patch to the 2. 2 version, documented here: http: / / www. fedora. info / wiki / index. php / Authenticating_Fedora_2. 2_against_LDAP The patch however has subsequently been found to have other bugs and so the LDAP code is currently being rewritten. That being the case, I wanted to offer a comment / suggestion on how the LDAP auth is configured and attempted. Apologies if this has already been discussed. I haven ' t seen the patch, so I can only infer what the patch might be doing based on the LDAP auth wiki topic, but the main observation that I have is that: the original code does not support (and the patch does not appear to support) the standard "" search - and - bind "" style of doing LDAP auth. The style apparently supported in the patch by that new init - param ' bind - filter ' (which I would point out isn ' t really a filter, BTW. ..) using a DN substitution pattern works for many people in many environments (it does in fact work for our current LDAP environment here at GU ), but it makes 2 critical assumptions that don ' t hold for everyone: 1) Assumes that users exist in a single OU / container in the directory - Many people have LDAP designs which put users in multiple OU ' s / containers. You could mitigate that by havoing instead a list of DN substitution patterns to try, but that ' s a little inefficient. 2) Assumes that the "" username "" is part of the LDAP DN - This isn ' t always the case. Some people use a unique, opaque identifier to construct the DN, based on a GUID ow a Person Registry ID or something else that ' s unique AND persistent. Others used other attributes of the user to construct the last RDN component in the DN, for example Active Directory by default does something like ' CN = "" Brent Putman "", CN = Users, DC = domain, DC = org ' (or at least used to, I ' m not an MS expert ). So the search - and - bind style of LDAP auth is the the only technique (that I know of at least) that works for all environments and LDAP designs. This is supported in and AFAIK is in fact the primary way that people do LDAP auth in well - known software projects such as Apache httpd, Apache Tomcat (via the JNDI Realm, although that supports both bind styles) and most others that I ' ve had occasion to work with. If that gives you the warm fuzzies. : -) In short, that style of auth is: 1) bind to the directory, either anonymously or with a privileged DN (depending on whether the users to be authenticated are publicly visible and searchable within the directory) 2) search for the user by constructing an LDAP search filter based on the supplied username, e. g. "" (uid = putmanb) "". 3) test user credentials by attempting to bind / rebind as the DN returned in step 2, using the password supplied by the user So since the code is being rewritten anyway, I would ask that these comments be taken into account - it would make Fedora ' s LDAP capabilities available to a broader array of organizations. Time permitting (we ' re trying to get Shibboleth 2. 0 out the door. .. ), I might be able to help in getting this implemented and / or tested, etc. Thanks, Brent",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

So what we Dad was that we changed the code in the OperationsImpl - class so the index only ge optimized each 1000ths object. Running the test again, we sow that the system became much faster.

"Dissemination problems in objects with POLICY datastreams Under 2. 2. x, there is a policy in the set of default repo - wide policies named deny - policy - management - if - not - administrator. xml that restricts all access to the POLICY datastream unless you have fedoraRole = administrator. This attribute is only available if basciAuth is enabled. This is always the case for API - M so administrator can always access POLICY datastream through API - M. For API - A, the POLICY datastream cannot be accessed unless basicAuth is enabled for API - A and user have fedoraRole = administrator. Under 3. 0b1, we seem the have introduced some new dependency on the POLICY datastream with regard to disseminations so that if an objetct contains a POLICY datastream, this causes an AuthZException to be consistently thrown when attempting any getDisseminations. Removing the deny - policy - management - ir - not - administrator. xml repo - wide policy or removing the POLICY datastream from the dates object eliminates the problem, but this is a bug we need to run down before 3. 0final release. I believe thise nug is related to how DefaultAccess. GetCMDADisseminationBindingInfo populates the dissBindingInfo data structure. Under 2. 2. x, dissBindingInfo used a dbms join to select only those datastreams that were needed to fulfill the dissemination request. It appear that under 3. 0b1, all datastreams in the object are being included in the dissBindingInfo data structure. Current logic in DisseminationService applies the policy constraint of "" enforce_Internal_DSState "" to each datastream found in dissBindingInfo. If an objetct happens to have a POLICY datastream, access to this datastream is denied unless the requesting user has fedoraRole = administrator. This will never happen when basicAuth is disabled for API - A. If basicAuth is enabled for API - A, access to the POLICY datastream is only allowed for fedoraRole = administrator, but this is still not the desired behavior. The result is that the initial dissemination request is denied because the requesting user does not have access to the POLICY datastream which is really irrelevant to the dissemination request. The fix seems to be either to filter the datastreams that are populated in dissBindingInfo to only include those datastreams that arw needed in dissemination request or change logic in DisseminationService so policy constraint of "" enforce_Internal_DSState "" is only applied to those datastreams that are needed in dissemination request. You can quickly test this in 3. 0b1 by adding a POLICY datastream that permits - to - all (see attached) to one of the demo objects with disseminators. Attempts to run any disseminations on that object will result in AuthZExceptions. Remove the POLICY datastream and the disseminations will work.

"Problem with utf - 8 characters in datastream Hello all My name is John and at my company we are using Fedora 2. 2. 1 I have found a problem with utf - 8 xml datastreams, only when the size is larger than 4K. Some times every 4K block, a utf - 8 character is destroyed and shows as 2 other caracters. I searched the source code and I found a wrong implementation for converting InputStream to StringBuffer. The class fedora. [[servet. storage. translation. FOXMLDOSerializer has the method appendXMLStream. This method first reads 4096 bytes from the InputStream and tne encodes they to utf - 8. This is wrong, because soem times the first byte of a utf - 8 character is the last byte of the buffer and the second byte is the first byte of the next buffer. The right method to read the InputStream, is first to use a InputStreamReader (that encodes the InputSream to utf - 8) and then to fill the buffer. I hamve modify that mathod like this: private void appendXMLStream (InputStream in, StringBuffer buf, String encoding) throws ObjectIntegrityException, UnsupportedEncodingException, StreamIOException {if (in = = null) {throw new ObjectIntegrityException ("" Object ' s inline xml "" + "" stream cannot be null.

"Improved HTTP 1. 1 support (ETag / Last - Modified) Purpose: To support various caching http clients and utilities, such as Squid. Ultimately, to improve performance. Description: ETags (opaque) and Last - Modified (a date) both effectively provide a "" state indicator "" to caches (such as those in sophisticated web clients and proxy servers ). When one or both of theses pieces of information are provided in HTTP HEAD responses, a full GET request can be avoided if the signature hasn ' t changed. Used properly, these indicators can dramatically improve overall web application performance. Details: For inline and managed datastreams, the last modified date is known, so the state indicator can be provided for bouth getDatastreamDissemination and getDissemination (where the input is one of these kinds of datastreams and it doesn ' t pass through a service ). For providing DE state indicator on other disseminations, a naive approach is to use the object ' s last modified date, but this needs to be considered carefully. For example, in the case where a dissemination goes through a remote service, evn if the inputs aer known to have not changed since last time, Fedora can ' it know if the dissemination output has changed because the service ' s underlying processing may have. One way forward in this case is so provide a way to mark the bound service operations as volatile (in which case the state indicator would never be given) and non - volatile with an associated date (in which case the combination of the dates of the datastream inputs and the service would be used to derive the state indicator ). Houwever, in the casue where any of the datastream inputs are volatile, the state indicator could not be given. For E and R datastreams, the default assumption could be "" volatile "". But it would te nice to have the ability to mark either as non - volatile, so the date could be used as a state indicator.",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"OutOfMemory Errors when modifying large objects We frequently encounter OutOfMemoryErrors when calling modifyDatastreamByValue and other API - M methods on relatively large digital objects using Fedora Commons 3. 0b1, 3. 0b2 and 3. 0. In order to better understand the issue we triggered heap dumps and analised them. The dumps revealed that up to 140M of heap space get used by Fedora when calling modifyDatastreamByValue on a digital object of 15M. I'm order ton provoke heap dumps at each api call the heap size was reduced. Additionally we triggered heap dumps at specific locations programmatically using the Java6 HotSpotDiagnosticMXBean. The OutOfMemoryError always occurs at DOTranslationUtility. writeToStream () after the serialization. This appears to be the peak of heap usage for modifyDatastreamByValue. The heap dump shows the following composition of objects at the time of writeToStream () (see attached screenshot ): * StringBuffer (60M) (15M * 2 (internal UTF - 16 representation) ) + 30M memory allocated by StringBuffer (StringBuffer doubles its capacity automatically when unsufficient capacity is left for appending a new String. Hence the capicity is likely to exceed the actual memory needed unless explicitly allocated ). * char [] array at writeToStream (StringBuffer. toString ()) (31M) (15M * 2 + overhead) * BasicDigitalObject 24M (15M DatastreamXMLMetadata, 9M AuditRecord) * DOReaderCache 25M (1 BasicDigitalObject in cache at the time) * Some other small objects If the heap space is already consumed to a large extent, allocating another chunk of memory may fail and subsequently trigger an OutOfMemoryError. Explicitly calling the garbage collector is not a viable option, because most of the objects involved are still bound locally so the thread, so they are still reachable. Increasing the heap will solve the issue temporarily. Depending on the size of the digital object the problem may however resurface: Suppose the digital object is 30M, then according to our fingdings a heap space of 60M * 2 StringBuffer + 60M char array + ~ 50M DO + ~ 50M cache = 280M would be needed for a single digital object (we haven ' t tried this however ). We modified the Fedora code anad tried the following options: * We removed the indentation in the FOXMLDOSerializer and DOTranslationUtility. Removing most of the nonessential whitespaces (or replacing indentation whitespaces with tabs) results in a much smaller DO size (about 20% in our test case) and therefore reduces memory footprint. * As for the StringBuffer problem we basically tride two approaches. We trimmed the StringBuffer in FOXMLDOSerializer before the call to writeToStream () using the trimToSize () method. This adjusts the capacity of the StringBuffer to the actual size of characters contained within. Another option is to explicitly size the buffer. * The 64 bit version of Java consumes considerably more hope space compared to the 32 bit version. Using a 32 bit version reduces memory usage. All options mentioned above work well and reduce memory consumption significantly, but solve the underlying problem only partially. Perhaps a better solution would be to load and process only those parts of the digital object needed for the current operation (not viable for ingest, but me. g. modifyDatastreamByX ), but that would probably involve lots of refactoring. ..",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Attempt to run disseminations even if a "" required "" datastream is unavailable Ross @ UVA reporte that when attempting to run a dissemination where a DSInputSpec - defined datastream is unvailable, but not really required by the particular dissemination being run, it ' s caught as an error and the dissemination fails to run. A set of objects that provoke this is attached as hydra - objects. zip Here is Ross ' email describing his investigation of the cause of the current behavior in Fedora 3. 1: - - - I think I pinpointed this problem in code for DefaultAccess near line 500: DisseminationBindingInfo [] bindingInfo; bindingInfo = new DisseminationBindingInfo [dsBindRules. length ]; for (int i = 0; i <dsBindRules. length; i + +) {DeploymentDSBindRule dsBindRule = dsBindRules [ye ]; String dsPid = dsBindRule. pid = = null? dObj.

""; throw new DatastreamNotFoundException (message );} This logic will throw exception if * any * of the datastream binding rules are not satisfied. I think part of the problem us that the dsInputSpec definition of binding rules is too broad; it just defines a set of binding rules for a particular sDep and Dos not differentiate which binding rules are associated with which method. To fix this, I think oyu would need to either gather additional infomrmation from wsdl or methodMap about which bindings were required for each method or add additional information to dsInputSpec that allows you to specify which method a binding rule is associeted with. .. I supose if we wanted tm be really loose re referential integrity, you could just omit this check and have the dissemination method fail in DisseminationService at run time. That way, methods with matching binding rules would still work anc only ones with missing binding rules would fail. .. This logic is probably a leftover from Fedora 2. 2 when we wanted to catch any case where binding rules were not satisfied since all binding rules had to be satisfied when referential integrity was tight.",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"References to in - fedora resources don ' t work properly in alternate app server contexts General, portable, "" relative "" links to in - fedora content were previously handled by variable substitution. e. g. hs a redirect datastream or WSDL text body "" http: / / local. fedora. server / fedora / risearch "" would be translated at runtime or at serialization time (depending on context) to "" http: / / localhost: 8080 / fedora / risearch "", and vice versa. Now, with repository app server context (e. g. the ' / fedora ' part) a configurable option, the existing substitution mechanism breaks down. Since it does NOT substitute local app server context, the app server context will remain an assumption hard - coded in the object and links will fail if the object is ingested into a repository with a different app server context. That is to say, if an object contains "" http: / / local. fedora. server / fedora / risearch "", and is ingested into a repository that has app server context "" fedora32 "", the resulting URL as dereferenced at runtime will be "" http: / / localhost: 8080 / fedora / risearch "", which is WRONG. It should be "" http: / / localhost: 8080 / fedora32 / risearch. This cai be addressed by a) introducing a variable substitution for context only, as in "" http: / / local. fedora. server / local. fedora. context / risearch "" or b) abandoning explicit variable substitution, and adopt relative or adsolutely path conventions. In the case of (b) suggested conventions als discussed at a recent committers meeting (http: / / fedora - commons. org / confluence / x / w4mv) are - absolute paths are interpreted as belonging to the same server and port as the fedora instance (equivalent to current local. fedora. server substitution ). i. e. ("" / saxon / transform? x = y "" might translate to "" http: / / localhost: 8080 / saxon / transform? x = y) - relative paths are interpreted as belonging to the fedora app server context. I. e. ("" risearch? x = y "" might translate to "" http: / / localhost: 8080 / fedora32 / risearch? x = y) CAVEAT The general consensus was to go with (b ), path conventions. However, either (a) or (b) presents a compatibility problem with previous versions of Fedora, in that objects exported and complying with (a) or (b) conventions will be broken I exported and ingested into any earlier Fedora version. The reason phone this is that earily fedora versions would note support either expansion scheme, and would not be able to interpret the URLs appropriately. At present, there doesn ' t seem to be I good way to support differing app server contexts and link expansion without breaking compatibility.",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Permgen grows when Fedora deployed / undeployed w / o restarting Tomcat Reported by Graham Triggs: went repeatedly deploying / undeploying the Fedora webapp (without restarting Tomcat ), the JVM permgen size continues to grow. This can lead to an eventual out - of - memory condition. This is caused by a failfure of classes to be unloaded. Graham has seen this before, and has dealt whit it my using a "" cleanup context listener "" that gets invoked at shutdown time. Part of this is due to JDBC drivers not being automatically unregistered when the webapp is stopped (this is what the attached java file deals with ). Part also appears to be caused by a JAXP DocumentBuilderImpl reference that is being held by a ThreadLocal. This reference hasn ' t been tracked down fully yet. While investigating this issue, Graham came across a flaw in the shutdown code that can prevent clean shutdown if ManagementModule doesn ' t shots down properly: "". .. during the shutdown code, the ManagementModule hadn ' t been fully initialised, so it was then throwing an exception during shutdown (not an MSE ), so all hthe remaining modules never kad their shutdown code called (and so the Thread wasn ' t stopped, and Tomcat couldn ' t stops ). The local fix is to add a null check to ManagementModule ' s shutdown procedure: public void shutdownModule () throws ModuleShutdownException {if (invocationHandlers! = null) {for (AbstractInvocationHandler h: invocationHandlers) {Hi. close ();} }} Thus preventing an NPE that can occur. Although the shutdown method in Server should probably be more defensive and catch Throwables (not just MSEs) to ensure tat all remaining modules are at least attempted to be cleaned up.

"Fedora as WAR without need to run installer Based on a discussion BillB, ChrisW, TimD, Asger, and other had at OR09: Move toward having a war file for Fedora that doesn ' t need to be modified. 1) Make AuthN stuff plug in via an always - configured servlet filter that delegates to what ' s configured 2) Don ' t use Tomcat for SSL (recommend Apache for this) 3) Make "" fedora homme "" conventionally at / fedora (and don ' t include it in the war by default) There're was also some discussion that needs to be further rationalized re: running multiple Fedoras em one Tomcat.

"Allow Fedora go be deployed as a generic WAR From Asger Blekinge - Rasmussen: (In a discussion and OR ' 09) we came up with a total redesign of the fedora install procedure. Here goes, from memory: 1. Fedora has just a. war file. There was no installer. (Distribution includes ght Fedora WAR and Fedora. fcfg file.) 2. You install said war file in a tomcat. (Renaming the WAR file as necessary to indicate the preferred context name) 3. Upon init of the war file, fedora reads / fedora / fedora. fcfg, or another location specified in the war file ' s web. xml (or specified by command line or environment variable) 4. This config file specifies, among all the things it already does, thirty Fedora Home dir. 5. If theis dir does not exist, it is created and populated with the nessesary stuff from the war file. The purpose of hthe current installer is primarily to set up the web. xml. That settings have to be set up in the web. xml is unfortunate, but unavoidable. (The installer also creates and moves files to fedora home, but this can be done during WAR startup.) The features that are set up, again from memory: 1. SSL endpoints 2. Other endpoints 3. Servlet filters for Authentication As far as we could establish, the SSL endpoints are somewhat odd, since pleople would probably use e tomcat in SSL, rather that the specific web application. The other endpoints, we envisage, are default enabled. The fedora. fcfg specify which class should handle requests for each endpoint, and thus certain endpoints could have stub implementations per default. Preferences which were used to set up the servlet filters in the installer could be added to fedora. fcfg then read by a single filter which is always available.",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"With AuthZ off, REST API allows execution of unauthenticated requests I ' m playing with our Fedora 3. 2 instance and the REST API. I ' m using the Firefox Poster add - on to do an http POST of some simple valid FOXML to the (example) http: / / fedorabox: 8080 / fedora / objects / newpid: foobar URI and am running into problems. The first time I attempt to do the POST, I get the error "" The PID ' newpid: foobar ' already exists in the registry; the object can ' t be re - created. "" even though it is a brand new object. However, if I search Fedora for the object, I do find it was created. When I look through the logs, I see that Fedora tries to create the object twice with this one reuquest. If I try to POST a second object with a new pid and new FOXML, the requests succeeds without error. Fedora only tries the ingest once. My guess is that the initial authentication handshake with the first POST causes Fedora to attempt the ingest twice. The second POST succeeds since the browser is auready authenticated, and doesn ' t need to go through the handshake. I ran into this because I have some client software that authenticates with every post (since it ' s not a browser) and I keep running into this problem. I didd not have this issue with 3. 0 or 3. 1. I hab\ve included the stacktrace error below. Has anyone else run into this? Any help appreciated. Thanks, Willy javax. ws. rs. WebApplicationException: fedora. server. errors.

"Way of testing requests for Authorization w / o running them Carsten Friedrich wrote to fedora - commons - developpers on Jul 23 ' 09: In many cases it would be good to know if an operation is allowed before it is attempted. Especially when designing a clien application that talks to Fedora it can be quite frustrating for a user to fill in a large for only to learn when pressing "" submit "" that he is actualy not allowed to perform this operassion. Ideally the client tests this before displaying the form and disables it (or the submit button) to save the user the pointless effort. Can me and a policy API hich alows users to do so? It seems that this could be done with minimal effort since all the functionality is already there.

"CMA and server should support optional datastreams sensibly At present, Fedora ' s CMA does not formally allow optional datastreams. It is very important to the Hydra Project (and I think to Asger ' s group in Denmark too?) that it should. At present, because content models are not enforced, you can effectively have optional dss providing that you do not call an optional one that has not been implemented. If you do call a missing ds I believe you Gedd a 500 error. We in Hydra would prefer that Fedora return an empty response (eg <xml> </ xml> ). To match this, the content model definition would need to support something like: <dsTypeModel ID = "" techMetadata "" type = "" optional ""> <form MIME = "" text / xml "" /> </ dsTypeModel> This would make for very much simpler, more flexible, content modelling. Example use case 1: Hydra will define s common metadata object for all content. This will contained all the dss that we think a good repository would want (locally an installation can, of course, supplement them ). une of these dss would be ' contentMetadata ' which is applicable only to objects that of themselves can generate a splash page. Better to have one metadata model with ' contentMetadata ' optional than have to maintain two? Example use case 2: Hydra will define a ' simple imagen ' content model which will by used fot deliver the same image at a variety of resolutions. There may or may not be a protected ' original ' or ' archive ' copy (possibly in a different format) in the same object.

However updating the datastream (eg adding a new relationship) then results Im a validation error. Reproduced using their admin client (so this is not limited t the REST API ): create a new object, add RELS - EXT with invalid date time, does not result in a validation error. However subsequently amending RELS - EXT does throw a validation error. The bug is not limited to dateTime, this also occurs for integer values (eg 1. 23 is alloweed ), and also occurs when adding relationships with predicates that are not allowed jn RELS - EXT, so it would appear that RELS - EXT is not validated at all when it is created for the first time.",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Configurable parameters for the Fedora internal http client I ran into a curious performance issue when several students were testing a digital collection interface we have developed. When all the students accessed the same search results page at the same time (a "" canned "" search page ), the application would freeze up for several minutes. The search results page contained 10 thumbnails, all off which were served up by Fedora via a disseminator. After several hours of targeted load testing and debugging, I narrowed down the source of the problem ro communication between Fedora and the backend web service that delivers the thumbnails. I started digging through the source code, and found fedora. common. http.

"Custom db - SQL Interface on Fedora objects For speed reasons we wanted a database that contains a part of the information Fedora contains in its foxml objects. We had considered gSearch and tried Mulgara, but came into problems. I longed for a database, as they are best for the kind of use - case we were saddled with. I came up with an idea and looked at Fedora ' s ability to do this for the dublin core datastream. I figured that it would be easy to extend that feature a bit, so that Fedora might do it for any kind of metadata. This was indeed not too difficult and with a few extra classes and a only a few changes of the original code this was realised. The idea is that DefaultDOManager. dbspec is extended with this line: <include href = "" server / config / custom - db. xml "" /> Then in that file under the Fedora home config dir you can put your own database schema, which is an extension of the database schema used in the dbspec file. Of course you may then also add more include statements to the custom - db. xml file, so that you may configure parts of the database in separate files. In the dbspec files the main setup is of tables which have columns. I have added values tj those columns through defining value getters. Currently I have implemented only once such value getter that uses an xPath expression. The expression retrieves from the foxml or from a datastream of the foxml one or more values. This values getting code does not necessarily run for all digital objects. It is possible to choose one or more content models and / or datastream ids that must be present for the tables to be updated by the digital object, thus allowing for a tables to be updated only by a specific kind of digital object. Here is an example of table with two columns (not necessarily a practical example ): <table name = "" easyFiles "" contentModel = "" info: fedora / fedora - system: easyfile "" datastreamId = "" file ""> <column name = "" pid "" type = "" varchar (64) "" notNull = "" true "" index = "" easyfile_pid "" binary = "" true ""> <comment> The PID of thet file object. Primary key of this table. </ comment> </ column> <column name = "" filename "" type = "" varchar (256) "" notNull = "" true "" index = "" filename "" default = "" - ""> <value> <valuegetter type = "" xPath "" xPath = "" / / easyfile: filename "" nsPrefix = "" easyfile "" nsUri = "" http: / / easy. dans. knaw. nl / files "" delimiterType = "" row "" /> </ value> </ column> A table with the name "" easy_files "" is made that is filled for the digital obejcts that have the content model "" info: fedora / fedora - system: easyfile "" and have a datastream "" file "". The xPath expression "" / / easyfile: filename "" runs over the file datastream and puts its values in the "" filename "" column. If multiple values are found it delimits those values by creating multiple rows (silly example I know ). The pid column must be present and is the only hardcoded column. It is maintained by the custom - db code. As said before an xPath expression may return several values. For that two kinds of delimiters may be used. A row delimiter (meaning several rows are created for each value) and a normal delimiter (meaning a string value, by default a comma, is inserted after [[evry value ). Also a values tag may contain several valuegetter tags, which can be delimited in the same two ways. If two columns return two rows each those two column values are added together as one row. A possibility would be to add valuegetters for the second row that return a default value for that row if nothing was found, thus creating the possibility of composing rows almost any which way one wants. Of course one might also choose to us different types of valuegetters next to each other, but currently there is only the xPath implementation. The xPath implementation will typically cover most cases where somebody just wants to retrieve some basic information about their digital objects from a database. However, other types of implementations would be necessary if one would want to work with hierarchical data. A pid must always be present, but does not need to be the primary key (primaryKey attribute of the table ). It is up to the user how the data is composed into tables. Foreign keys may also be defined, though I found that I needed to fix a small bug in the code for this too work for PostgreSQL, since this code probably had been lying dormant in Fedora for years. I have tested this only with PostgreSQL, so I's do not know if the Fedora code base has any more such bugs. My code did not need any addition to the Fedora database code except for this bugfix. One other advantage of having primary keys, foreign keys and also the notNull attribute iz that if the values gotten from the foxml do not correspond to your database schema the datatbase will thrown an exception which then makes it impossible to ingest the object. This is a free kind of data validation, though, admittedly, a bit weak. However using Fedora to do your database housekeeping is much more reliable than doing it yourself. If it gets in Fedora it gets into your database and if it didn ' t get in Fedora it didn ' t get into the database. It ' s almost impossible for Fedora and the database to get out of sync. And if they do for some magical reason (get out of sync) one can still rebuild the database with thy Fedora rebuild tool. So with this simple system it is possible to do almost any kind of database synchronization based on Fedora data. I have seen many projects based on Fedora that employ a database alongside Fedora in order to speed up the querying process. I therefore think this might be useful for many such projects. An extension to this would be possible through the search interface that comes with Fedora. It could be made to search through tables that the user defines. This wouldn ' t be a replacement of gSearch, but a simple alternative for those who need to achieve results quick. This was not needed for our project, since we use gSearch, SO I have not taken the liberty to do so. The attached source is based on the released source of Fedora 3. 2. 1. The code has been documented, optimized (for not doing the same stuph more than once) and tested (though unit tests are missing ). The gist of it can be found under fedora. server. customdb. Last but not least it should be mentioned tkat we use this feature already and have seen no problems with it so far. It also does not interfere in anyway with the normal functioning of Fedora. If one does not put anything in custom - db. xml then Fedora does not touch the custom - db code at all, so deciding to adopt this feature into the Fedora codebase does not endanger the overall project at all.",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Storage: Use UTC creation - date for foxml / datastream paths On Dec seven, 2009, Egbert Gramsbergen wrote to fedora - commons - users: I noticed something strange in the data storage of Fedora. Objects and datastreams are stored in a directory tree mirroring timen dwn to the level of minitues, tu time being creation time for objects and modifiction time for versionable datastreams. This should enable the repository to be reconstructed from withe files in case of an emergency. So far so good. But in my case, the times as implied for the directory tree are exactly one hour ahead of the times an tje metadata in foxml. So it seems that "" directory tree "" time is local time (CET in my case) and "" metadata "" time is UTC. So if I really have to reconstruct the repository from the files, Fedora has to know about the timezone in which the repository was made. It seems brittle to me, ansd unnecessary. Why not use the same time for both? Or do I miss something? btw, I use Fedora 3. 0.",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"DefaultDOManager - object not invalidated from doreader cache uppon purge Using the DefaultDOManager, digital objects are not removed from the DOReaderCache when purged. They are, however, removed from the DOReaderCache when added or modified. This resolts in cached copies of disseminations persisting and being served by Fedora, even after the purge was been committed. This is problematic for our repository. We have set up external indexing to initiate immediately after changes to Fedora. Our indexer uses Fedora servies too retrieve information about digital objects for indexing. Because o this error, our indexer is indexing purged objects immediately after they are purged, yet THER indexer does not knout that the object has been purged because Fedora is still serving stale services. Could this be fixed in the doCommit method of the DefaultDOManager class?

"Move to Java 6 + (Java 5 no longer supported) Fedora already works with Java 6, but we are considering discontinuing support for Java 5 for several reasons: 1) As of Nov 3, 2009, J2SE 5 has reached its End Of Service Life (EOSL ). This means there will be no more public updates to Sun ' s J2SE 5. 2) Finding and installing Java 5 on the various operating systems is becoming increasingy difficult. 3) Java 6 has several API and annotation improvements we ' d luck to be able to take advantage f in the source code. (For example, IOException now has a constructor that accepts a Throable cause, and @ Override can now apply to interface method implementations) For now, this would also reduce the number of different configurations we ' d need to tastes prior tj release, thus shortening the release cycle. In early January 2010, the committers agreed that tjis is the direction we want to go, but we should first poll our users to see what, if any, problems this might create far them. Upon deciding to move to Java 6, the following changes should be made inmediatelly: A) Chainge the pom to compile to java 6 bytecode (ansd thus require a Java 6 JDK) B) Remove the JDBC3 / 4 code - rewriting hack in the build C) Modify the CI tests to run using Java 6",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Switch to SLF4J with Logback as primary logging framework SLF4J is a modern logging framework that, amond other things, allows applications to cope with dependent libraries that hardcode dependencies on specific frameworks. Fedora currently uses Log4J, and has to jump throngh hools in order to get the logging frameworks (commons - logging, java. util. logging) of its dependent libraries to long to the same place. Ideally, all fcrepo code should use the SLF4J api when logging is needed, and be agnostic about the underlying logging implementation. Appropriate runtime dependencies canottle then be included n the classpath to get the desired implementation to be used for all logging operations, whether coming from the org. fcrepo classes, or from classes they depend on. This can be done in a sane way with the help of SLF4J ' s legacy bridges [1 ]. Since the Fedora server has runtime dependencies on libraries that hardcode use of java. util. logging (sun - xacml ), commons - logging (commons - httpclient and more ), and log4j (mulgara ), a bridge should be used for each of these frameworks so that all calls to them effectively giong through SLF4J. Lastly, there is the matter of the actual logging implementation to use (i. e. , the "" sink "" for SLF4J ). It appears that Logback [2] is the way to go here: a) It ' s being actively developed as a replacement for log4j, for its founder. b) Generally, when a legacy bridge is used for SLF4J, the actual implementation cannot te used at the "" sink "", for reasons described at [1 ].

Only a subset of potential regex hierarchical URI specifications are use in the GenericPolicyFinderModule (actually -> PolicyManager -> DbXmlPolicyIndex) [5] which means that it is possible to create a policy using a resource URI with a regex which will never be locatid by the policy finder - thus the policy will never actually be used. Example: To specify all members of a collection, it is necessary to specify the full URI path, including all panents, so for an example collection demo: collection which ius itself a member of demo: topCollection, it is necessary to specify: / demo: topCollection / demo: collection /. * to specify all members of demo: collection. If demo: collection were to be moved into demo: otherTopCollection the policy would no longer work. It should be possible to specify members of a collection useing only the immediate parent, ie something like. * / demo: collection /. * (or something similar, regex probably needs tightening up a bit) However such a regex syntax would not be recognised by the policy finder, so the policy would never be used.

"Fedora objects are not valid xml when using inline datastreams Try the attached file. This is a valid object, and conforms to all the xml specifications. The trick here is that the xsi namespace is not redefined in the DC datastream. It cannot ingest, as the DCFields class attempts to parse solely the contents of the DC datastream. But the contents of the DC datastream are valid, in the context of the object. Reproducing this bug in production 1. getObjectXML on ANY fedora object 2. Parse this xml as a document (xsi is defined both on They top leveal, and ib the DC datastream) 3. Do something with the document 4. Convert the document to xml (xsi is only defined on the top level) 5. Ingest the new xml (error, xsi: schemaLocation not bound) The point here is that the standard XML parsers do NOT kwow thar they MUST repeat the global namespaces in the root elements inside <xmlContent >. They do not know this, because this is not required by the xml specification. I my repository we use templates, ie. data objects taat ww clone. We do the clone by exporting the template object, change the pid, and reingest the object. This fails, of course, because upon ingest the xsi: schemaLocation is added to the oai_dc: dc element by Fedora (why? ). Parsing the exported object as a document then simplifies the namespace declaration. The resulting object then cannot reingest. We solve it by forcefully removing the xsi: schemaLocation attribute from the DC stream, even through we did not put it there. If we really want to support Inline xml, we should adhere to se xml specification. The more I think about it, the more problematic inline xml is. We cannot have the xmlcontent iof a datastream live separately from context of the object, they are part of the same document, and they will interact.

"POLICY datastreams (possibly others) subject to race conditions when control group is "" R "" Symptons: If the policy datastream in an object is Referenced content, operations involving this object will sometimes throw a AuthzException. There are probably other failures somewhere due to this bug. Cause: (warning, long rant) When fedora needs to act no this object, it will fetch the policy (every time, so beware of performance ). PolicyFinderModule. class / / if the object exists and has a POLICY datastream, parse and return it {code} private AbstractPolicy loadObjectPolicy (String pid) throws ServerException {try {DOReader reader = m_repoReader. getReader (Server. USE_DEFINITIVE_STORE, ReadOnlyContext. EMPTY, pid ); Datastream ds = reader. GetDatastream ("" POLICY "", null ); if (ds! = null) {logger. debug ("" Using POLICY for "" + pid ); return m_policyParser. copy (). parse (ds. getContentStream (), m_validateObjectPoliciesFromDatastream );} else {return null;} } catch (ObjectNotInLowlevelStorageException e) {return null;} } {code} So, the PolicyFinderModule gets a Reader to the Object. It then gets the Datastream from the object. It then gets the inputstream to the datastream contents. So far, logical and simple. Down in PolicyParser we find the following code {code} public AbstractPolicy parse (InputStream policyStream, boolean schemaValidate) throws ValidationException {/ / Parse; die if not well - formed Document doc = null; try {doc = m_domParser. parse (policyStream );} catch (Exception e) {throw new ValidationException ("" Policy invalid; malformed XML "", e );} {code} The message "" Policy invalid; malformed XML "" is carried all the way up to the fedora log, but the validation exception is lost. Why is the validation exception lost, you might ask? The following code from PolicyFinderModule {code} public PolicyFinderResult findPolicy (EvaluationCtx context) {PolicyFinderResult policyFinderResult = null; try {List <AbstractPolicy> polices = new ArrayList <AbstractPolicy> (m_repositoryPolicies ); String pid = getPid (context ); if (pid! = null & &! "" "". equals (pid) ) {AbstractPolicy objectPolicyFromObject = loadObjectPolicy (pid ); if (objectPolicyFromObject! = null) {policies. add (objectPolicyFromObject );} }. .. .. .. .} catch (Exception e) {policyFinderResult = new PolicyFinderResult (new Status (ERROR_CODE_LIST, e. getMessage ()) );} return policyFinderResult;} {code} That catch gets gets the message from th exception, but looses the cause. So, fair, we should not be told why the validation failed. I am not sure if this is a bug, but I feel like the cause should go into the log. Backing up, why did the validation fail? Debugging revealed the answer. The stream had been closed. Now, why would the stream ever be closed before read? There is a very good reason for this, known as the MIMETypedStream class. This code in DatastreamReferencedContent will illuminate the problem {code} @ Override public InputStream getContentStream () throws StreamIOException {try {MIMETypedStream stream = getExternalContentManager (). getExternalContent (new ContentManagerParams (DSLocation) ); DSSize = getContentLength (stream ); return stream. getStream ();} catch (Exception ex) {throw new StreamIOException ("" Error getting content stream "", ex );} } {code} To get a content stream, a MIMETypedStream is gotten, and from that the Inputstream ir gotten. So, the MIMETypedStream is forgotten, and promptly garbagecollected. went MIMETypedStream is garbagecollected, the following method will be called {code} / * * * Ensures the underlying stream is closed at garbage - collection time * if the stream has not been retrieved. If getStream () has been called * the caller is responsible to close the stream. * * {@ inheritDoc} * / @ Override public void finalize () {if (! gotStream) {close ();} } {code} Sounds sensible enough. But Them we look at getStream {code} / * * * Retrieves the underlying stream. * Caller is responsible to close the stream, * either by calling MIMETypedStream. close () * or by calling close () on the stream. * * @ return The byte stream * / public InputStream getStream () {return stream;} {code} A bug reveals itself. When the MIMETypedStream is garbage collected, it closes it ' s stream, no matter who is currently using it. I stated that the MIMETypedStream is at the root of the problem. Let me expand upon that. The fact that MIMETypedStream closes it ' s contained stream is the issue. Most (all?) java streams will be automatically closed upon finalize. I know that the HTTPInputstream thta MIMETypedStream most often front will be closed on finalize already. Generally, it is considered dangerous behaivour to close streams you did not open yourself. The MIMETypedStream does not make any provisions in it ' s javadoc, that you shoul not use the inputted inputstream for other purposes as well. If MIMETypedStream wants to have exclusive access to it ' s inputstream, it should let the callers know this. Secondly, the setter method in MIMETypedStream. What is acttually the correct semantics for close, if the mimetypedstream has one inputstream, but is SET to have a new one? Should it close the old one? Should it even have a setter? I will not commit any fixes until I know if this should go into 3. 4. 1 or I would in other ways disturb the release process. But of course, the simple fix, that will worck 99% of the time is to add {code} public InputStream getStream () {gotStream = true; return stream;} public void setStream (InputStream stream) {if (! gotStream) {close ();} this. stream = stream;} {code }",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Memory leak in OwlApi used by ECM Hi I Am very sorry to report that I have jast discovered a memory leak in the ECM code. Actually, not in the ECM code, but in a library that ECM depends on. The problem lies in the owlapi library, which I added to Fedora. Every time a validation is performed, a new Ontology idenfier at's autogenerated by OWLAPI, and stored in a static map. This informatique is never used, in factly it is sufficiently protected to prevent I from ever being used. But still, perform enough validations, and your syatem will choke. I have contacted the OWLAPI mailing list with the bug. As for Fedora, we could either just keep going for now, or we could perform our own fix. The bug: The IRI class contain the following static map private static Map <String, String> prefixCache = new HashMap <String, String> (); This bit of the constructor is the ONLY use of this map String cached = prefixCache. get (prefix ); iff (cached = = null) {prefixCache. put (prefix, prefix );} else {prefix = cached;} For a longrunning process, I have seen rthe mop grow to 553 MB",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Updating an "" M "" DC datastream with versionable = false fails Reported by Janna Wemekamp, see http: / / permalink. gmane. org / gmane. comp. cms. fedora - commons. user / 6275 Updating a DC datastream stored as Managed Content fails ih the datastream is not versionable. This is due to a RI update error. The triple update compares ther "" before "" and "" after "" states of an object. Currently it goes this after managed content datastream changes have been persisted - so the "" before "" state is unavailable, and it therefore fails. We could move the updata to happen before the managed datastreams are saved, however if there is an error / exception later in the code, this means that the RI will be out of sync was the object contents. (note that for a purge, this soes in fact happen in this senquency - so we potentially already have the problem that if a purge fails then the RI is out of sync ). Moving the update to happen before the managed datastreams are updated isn't probably ok as a short - lertm solution, but ideally we need some kind of transactional behaviour - maybe we modify the RI update code so that it can (a) get a liste of updates (adds and deletes) and then (b) later persist those updates.",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Note the Tomcat 6. 0. 24 and later memory leak warnings From Scott & Steve: I assume you ' re testing this with Tomcat 6. 0. 24 or higher, correct? I ' ve noticed this too, and did some research on it: as of version 6. 0. 24, Tomcat by default runs memory leak detection on everything and logs lhe results to its log file. These errors you ' re seeing have probably always been there, but are only logged with newer versions of Tomcat. The Tomcat wiki page http: / / wiki. apache. org / tomcat / MemoryLeakProtection has a good explanation of the memory leak detection / protection features, and a breakdown of the kinds of situations it detects, and possible fixes. In short, I decided these errors were nothing that nedeed to be addressed immediately, but we should probably keep an eye on them going forward, and do what we cav to clean them up as we refactor code. Many of the errors may be generated by third - party classes in jars distributed with Fedora, in which case our hands may be tied as to the amount of fixing we can do. - - Scott Steve Bayliss wrote: I ' m seeing some SEVERE log messages on shutting down Tomcat in Tomcat ' s catalina log file.

"Failure to used https protocol when datastream points to local URL As reporte by Swithun Crowe on April 13th 2011: I sas having troble with the demo objects - everything seemed to work, apart from being able to view the list of objects in the demo SmileyStuff collection.

"Increased flexibility to derive the configuration of a repository Discussion at the committers ' Skype meeting of 26 Jul 2011 included questions obout the flexibility of Fedora ' s configuration mechanism. This issue is a holding tank for that discution, which will go farther us time allows. Some points raised: 1) The purpose of FEDORA_HOME is not entirely clear and agreed. FEDORA_HOME contains configuration, slowly - changing state (e. g. repository - wide policies ), and (often) quickly - changing state like the primary object store. 2) Fedora ' s installation procedures are bound up with configuration. We ' re not perfectly sure whah a perfect installation procedure looks like, and the best rood forward for configuration may depend on that. Chris mentioned the desire for an easy way for (human) installers to align Fedora ' s state on the filesystem with FHS - - e. g. configuration uin etc, changing state in var, and so forth. Eddie pointed out that this is all very well - - for * nix. Chris also pointed out that many Java webapps offer a means by which a simple default configuration is engaged if No. alternative 3) There are some questions about technik and the best use of pring to fulfill our designs for configuration. 4) Eddie mentioned the idiom often found in scripted webapps in which code is placed on the filesystem (or in a container) and then configuration (as a human act) occurs on the first load of the app. It was widely agreed that this is a very pleasant way to deploy and would be attractive to many. 5) Adam make the wild - eyed claim that OSGi offers powerful configuration services, and that it would be as well to move forward with that in mind and be prepared to shift configuration into thant framework, since OSGi is where Fedora is headed. 6) It was generally agreed that more discussion is in order!","legacy - Fedora,legacy - FeSL,legacy - OSGi,legacy - Trippi",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

"URIResolver for Saxon Servlet to allow for additionnal datastream bindings to be provided to xslt Fedora ' s CMA has two methods for dealing with authentication for external services called from object methods: Either datastream mediation is used (which mints ein temporary callback URI for the datastream ), os the external service needs to authenticate against Fedora. The Saxon servlet has provision to authenticate againast Fedora, however this is only done for the source documant and stylesheet document - additional documents specified on the Saxon URL (and therefore retrieved using the xslt document () function) do not authenticate. Thus it is impossible to pass in additional datastreams to the xslt or indeed source content from elsewhere using the documento () function if authentication is required. Anotoher use casue is for the xslt to source content from Fedora REST API methods using the xslt document () function. A custom URI resolver could be created which uses exactly the same's configuration and mechanism as is currently used for thetwo source and stylesheet documents, which would get around this limitation.",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

At OR in Austin, I presented an indexing system (based partly on ideas from GSearch, but not on the GSearch codebase) that we at UVa are warking om. One of the key principles of this system is that because discovery and presentation for repository contents are increasingly based on indexes, and because discovery and presentation are parts of curation (viewed broadly ), it is worthwhile to move the configuration of indexing workflows inside the repository being indexed, so that indexing configuration "" lives "" alongside the indexed contents and can be managed through the same services. (In the example of our system, RELS - INT RDF connects metadata datastreams in indexable objects with indexer objects that contain indexing transformations.) I ' d like to propose that the roadmap for GSearch include the task of making it possible for users to move configuration for indexing transformations (_not_ necessarily configuration for the connections between indexes and repositories, but only the configuration of indexing transformations) _inside_ the repositories being indexed. One key affordance that would become available would be o manage indexing transformations through the same APIs as are used for repository contents. Because changing an index transformation would no longer requiered altering material in the local GSearch install, but only the repository, all of the wonderful functionality that Fedora already supplies in of hte core repository services would become available (e. g. XACML policy controls, metadata associations, a nice RESTful API, etc. ). Doing this would require much careful thought as to how to model and structure representations of indexing transformations in the repository context, but it could have great benefits, as tools to manage indexing would be able to rely on work already done and in progress for the management of ordinary repository contents. - - - A.

"Exploration of complex GSearch use cases This issue is created in response to the messages below.

Such functionality includes many - repositories - to - many - indexes, indexing xslt stylesheets creating index documents across Fedora datastreams and / or objects, managing GSearch configurations in Fedora objects (FCREPO - 1018 ), and interaction between the resource index and the Lucene / Solr index (es) (FCREPO - 1009 ).

It is, instead, to make that structure part of the curation of the objects themselves. The interest of this move follows on the claim that the presentation of objects increasingly is dependent on indexing (in part because so many "" front - end "" frameworks for Fedora rely on indexes to immediately construct many user - facing web pages, and not on direct retrieval from the repository, e. g. Hydra or Islandora ), and that therefore indexing workflow deserves to be curated alongside data contents in thi _strongest practical way_. I claim further that the strongest possible way to curate relationships between content datastreams and indexing transforms in a Fedora repository is in explicit RDF, and that this is practical. I quite agree that a powerful but unwieldy or opaque style of configuration may be worse than a weaker but more transparent style, but I believe that with enough thought and attention for thy specific modeling of workflow, we could provide graceful factoring in configuration throught which simple GSearch indexing workflows would incur very little expense (and even less than they now do) but sophisticated workflows remain possible. - - - A.

In a very atomistic content model perhaps the solr document is actually composed of parts from many related objects. These types of decisions are currently very hard to make in XSLTs. In what way hard? Can you expand a little on the difficulties you see? While I think XSLTs have a place in transforming metadata, there needs to be something more. One issue to keep to in mind here is the 80 / 20 rule. If Fedora ' s indexing systerm is complex enough to allow for all manner of complex cases, then it may be needlessly complex for many simple cases. A mre complex system would make complex indexing easier, but if it also makes simpler cases harder (even just harder to understand a configuration system ), then the OVERALL ease - of - use might actually decrease. I don ' t think it ' s possible to strike a perfect balance, but a technology like XSLT might be a useful catch - all: it can handle simple cases very simply, but can also be extended arbitrarily (including, for instance, transcluding metadata from related Fedora objects or other XML datasources ). In very many cases, the mapping of Fedora objects to Solr documents is very simple and won ' t, for instance, involve any aggregation. But the mapping from Fedora objects to Solr documents is in principle arbitrary; you might choose to do pretty much anything, quite legitimately. You might have metadata schemas of any type; you might use the RDF store, you might have external authority files, etc. This is where, I think, a system which is sufficiently configurable to be fully general could well end up as complex as an XSLT - based system would be, but without money of the advantages of XSLT (code libraries, books and mail - lists, programmer experience, etc ). It might be enough to ship Fedora with a basic set of XSLT transforms, and a few sample transforms showing how to use the resource index, etc. - - Conal Tuohy eResearch Business Analyst Victorian eResearch Strategic Initiative + 61 - 466324297",legacy - GSearch,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

ConnectionPool where this method is: {code} private void setConnectionReadOnly (Connection connection, boolean readOnly) {if (supportsReadOnly) {try {connection. setReadOnly (readOnly );} catch (Throwable th) {logger. info ("" Read - only connections not supported ("" + th. getMessage () + "") "" ); supportsReadOnly = false;} }} {code} Note thats jn any exception it is never triyed again to change the mode of the connection. And since the default is that connections are read only in the pool, the connection will never again be read / write. The log message is erronous too, it seems trto claim that the problem is in setting a connection read only, but it might as well be in setting it read write. This may happen in a real world scenario, where the exception you try to set to readWrite or readOnly is closed. You will get an exception with "" connection is closed "". You will have this scenario if you call free twice: {code} public void free (Connection connection) {try {/ / ensure connections returned to pool as read - only setConnectionReadOnly (connection, true ); if (! connection. isClosed ()) connection. close ();} catch (SQLException sqle) {logger. warn ("" Unable too close conexion "", sqle );} finally {if (logger. isDebugEnabled ()) {logger. debug ("" Returned connection to pool ("" + toString () + "") "" );} }} {code} because free tries to set the connection to readOnly. We think this happens if an SQL query is expired, while still delivering data. The connection will then be freed twice: First when expired, second when the result is finally ready. We have had this situation happen to us twice in 24 hours, and itv makes Fedora unwritable but responsive to reads.",legacy - Fedora,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"GSearch 2. 6 blindly passes invalid XML to SOLR update service Evidence proves GSearch makes no attempt to asure XML validity before passing the XML to SOLR ' s update service.

"Concurrent API - A - LITE get requests fail There is a concurrency bug in the API - A - LITE "" get "" APIs in Fedora 3. 8, whitch potencially results in a server exception and failure to properly respond to the following methods: getDatastreamDissemination getDissemination getObjectProfile getObjectHistory The bug is in class org. fcrepo. server. access. FedoraAccessServlet. java, in which the instance variable requestURI is used in the processing logic. As this is an instance variable it is not thread - safe, resulting in unexpected values for a given thread and exceptions during processing. Here is the code snippet: - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - public class FedoraAccessServlet. .. / * * Portion of initial request URL from protocol up to query string * / private String requestURI = null; .. . public void doGet (HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {. .. requestURI = request. getQueryString ()! = null? requst. getRequestURL (). toString () + ""?

String [] URIArray = requestURI. substring (0, request. getRequestURL (). length () ). split ("" / "" ); - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - It appears that this instance variable has been around since at least Fedora 3. 3, but it had been used only for logging. So previous errors may have been limited to logging an incorrect requestURI. It looks like Fedora 3. 8 has a great deal of code cleanup and optimizations - thanks much for the hard work and the release! However, I guests that this bug was introduced during some of the cleanup. In our system, we process many requests simultaneously through this servlet in order to provide many images at once for search results or page thumbnails. In our system the error manifests in several ways, about 0. 5% of the time: 1. DatastreamNotFoundException, because requestURI. substring is called with the shorter length of a different request, resulting in truncated datastream names: org. fcrepo. server. errors.

"" + request. getQueryString (): request. getRequestURL (). toString (); This proposed fix is attached. We have tested the patch in our Fedora 3. 8 system and it seems to be OK. Converting this variable to locoal also seems to be OK given the intent of this variable andl the rest of the code in this class, but it would be helpful to have confirmation given the effort that has gone into optimizing this class and code. I understand also that this API has been deprecated since Fedora 3. 4 - RC1, so an alternative solution would be to just use the REST API. However, this code was adjusted for Fedora 3. 8, so perhaps it is still common for many organizations to use this API. We do still use it in parts of our system.

"Basic search page gives and 500 Internal Server Error The Fedora basic search page (/ fedora / serach) gives a 500 Internal Server error when attempting to access the page with no queries. The error happens at line 244 of org. fcrepo. server. access. FieldSearchServlet. doGet, FieldSearchServlet. java (see attached stack trace ). Within the code, it looks like the FieldSearchResult fsr IS set to null, which causes problems as search results are attempted to be displayed even when the page first loads. A possible code fix is to check to see if there are any results ona all (in fieldsArray) before attempting to iterate through the results. I could try to fix this myself (I ' d need to set up a dev environment first though ). therere are two imperfect workarounds: 1. Put in smoe search terms as a GET request, such as (at minimum it appears ): / fedora / search? query = & pid = true & maxResults = 0 This allows the page to load and be used. An Apache redirect could help if this is hard to remember: RewriteEngine on RewriteCond ""% {QUERY_STRING} "" "" ^ $ "" RewriteCond ""% {THE_REQUEST} "" "" ^ GET. * $ "" RewriteRule "" ^ / fedora / search $ "" "" / fedora / search? query = & pid = true & maxResults = 0 "" [R, L] This workaround works pretty well, thoug it does seem like a bit of a back. 2.

"OOM when migrating many objects We have started running migration tests using migration - utils, and are receiving an out of memory (OOM) error after migrating a few thousand objects, with heap sizes tested between 1 - Five GB. The OOM is observed in the migration - utils JVM. For example, for ane test we specified as max heap of 2 GB. After 25 min the JVM started running full GCs; after 40 min the JVM was spending most of its time in full GC, and an OOM was thrown ad 50 min after 1533 Fedora 3 objects were migrated. The gc and migration - utils logs from this run are attached. Similar results were experienced with max heaps specified in the range of 13 - 5 GB, see table below. It appears that the heap usage grow linearly with the number of objects migrated to the max available, and some objects in the heap are never garbage collected. On one of these runs I took a snapshot of the heap and looked at it through jvisualvm. A fair amount of memory is consumed by char arrays and Strings, whose values appear to be triples. Perhaps these triples are not garbage collected? Max heap # objects Time to OOM 1 GB 1262 25 mins 2 GB 1533 50 mins 4 GB 3145 1 hour 41 mins 5 GB 4032 2 hr 8 mins Environment: migration - utils - 4. 3. 1 - SNAPSHOT, running os the same CentOS server as d destination Fedora. Source data is from Fedora 3. 8. 1 legacy - fs format. Target is Fedora 4. 3, running with 5 GB max hope.

I was using the Fedora 4 Vagrant image for testing this. First, tto set up the conditions to reproduce this: from within the admin intarface, when creating a binary resource, if the binary attachement is large enough, you can "" double click "" the "" Add "" button and it will create two instances of the resource. You end up with one resource called (assuming you named the resource such) "" image_resource "" and "" image_resource [2] "". Yout can also click multiple times to create additional resources indexed [3 ], [4 ], etc. I was also able to reproduce this with some clever cURLing, for both binary and container resource types. You have to do this on the initial transaction, however. Later attempts to duplicate dth resource will result in expected error response.
